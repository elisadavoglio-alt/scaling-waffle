### 📜 ANTHOLOGY EXAMPLES (GROUND TRUTH)

--- CHARLES BAUDELAIRE ---
[Correspondences]
Nature is a temple in which living pillars
Sometimes give forth a confused babble of speech;
Man passes there through forests of symbols
Which watch him with familiar eyes.
Like prolonged echoes mingling in the distance
In a deep and tenebrous unity,
Vast as the dark of night and as the light of day,
Perfumes, sounds, and colors correspond.

[The Albatross]
The Poet is like the prince of the clouds
Who haunts the tempest and laughs at the archer;
Exiled on the ground amidst the jeers,
His giant wings prevent him from walking.

[Spleen (IV)]
When the low, heavy sky weighs like a lid
On the groaning spirit, victim of long ennui,
And from the all-encompassing horizon
Pours us a black day sadder than nights...

[To the Reader]
Folly, error, sin, and stinginess
Occupy our minds and labor our bodies,
And we feed our amiable remorse
As beggars nourish their vermin.

[A Carcass]
Remember the object we saw, my soul,
That sweet summer morning so mild:
At the turn of a path, a carcass, infamous,
On a bed sown with stones...
And the sky watched that opening flower
Like a carcass explicitly.

[The Enemy]
My youth was nothing but a dark storm,
Traversed here and there by brilliant suns;
Thunder and rain have made such havoc
That there remain very few red fruits in my garden.

[Invitation to the Voyage]
There, all is order and beauty,
Luxury, peace, and pleasure.
See on these canals
Those vessels sleeping...

[The Cat]
Come, my beautful cat, on my amorous heart;
Retain the claws of your paw,
And let me plunge into your beautiful eyes,
Mixed with metal and agate.

[Hymn to Beauty]
Do you come from the deep sky or the abyss,
O Beauty? Your gaze, infernal and divine,
Pours out confusingly benevolence and crime,
Wherefore one may compare you to wine.

[The Clock]
The Clock! God frightful, impassive, and malicious,
Whose finger threatens us and says: "Remember!"
The vibrating Pain will plant itself in your full heart
Like into a target.

--- STÉPHANE MALLARMÉ ---
[The Azure]
The eternal Azure's lucid irony
Overwhelms, beautifully indolent as flowers,
The impotent poet who curses his genius
Through a sterile desert of Sorrows.

[Sea Breeze]
The flesh is sad, alas! and I have read all the books.
To flee! to flee there! I feel that birds are drunk
On being among the unknown foam and the skies!

[A Throw of the Dice (Un coup de dés)]
A THROW OF THE DICE
NEVER
WILL ABOLISH
CHANCE
Even when launched in eternal circumstances
From the depths of a shipwreck...

[The Tomb of Edgar Poe]
Such as into himself at last eternity changes him,
The Poet arouses with a naked sword
His age stricken with horror not to have known
That death had triumphed in this strange voice!

[The Swan]
The virgin, vivid, and beautiful today—
Will it tear us with a drunken wingbeat
This hard, forgotten lake haunted under the frost
By the transparent glacier of flights not fled!

[Apparition]
The moon grew sad. Seraphim in tears
Dreaming, finger on the bow, in the calm of flowers
Vaporous, drew white sobs gliding
From their dying viols.

[Saint]
At the window concealing
The sandalwood old gold of her viol
Formerly with flute or mandore,
Is the pale Saint...

[The Afternoon of a Faun]
These nymphs, I would perpetuate them.
So clear,
Their light carnation, that it hovers in the air
Heavy with tufted slumbers.
Was it a dream I loved?

[Fan]
With language nothing more than a wing
To hide the face from you
There is piercing the shadows
A little enshrouded spice.

[Sonnet in X (Ses purs ongles...)]
Her pure nails very high dedicating their onyx,
Anguish, this midnight, upholds the lamp-bearer,
Many vesperal dreams burned by the Phoenix
That are not gathered in the funeral urn.

--- ARTHUR RIMBAUD ---
[The Drunken Boat]
As I was floating down impassive Rivers,
I no longer felt myself guided by haulers...
I ran! And the Peninsulas delivered
From their moorings have never known a chaos more triumphant.

[Vowels]
A black, E white, I red, U green, O blue: vowels,
I shall tell, one day, your latent birth:
A, black hairy corset of shining flies
Which buzz around cruel stenches...

[Sensation]
In the blue summer evenings, I will go along the paths,
Picnicked by the wheat, treading on the short grass:
Dreaming, I will feel the coolness on my feet.
I will let the wind bathe my bare head.

[The Sleeper in the Valley]
It is a green hollow where a river sings
Madly catching on the grasses silver
Rags...
A young soldier, mouth open, bare head,
And the nape of his neck bathing in cool blue cress,
Sleeps.

[A Season in Hell (Night of Hell)]
I have swallowed a famous gulp of poison.
Three times blessed be the mistake that came to me!
My entrails burn. The violence of the venom twists my limbs.

[Departure]
Seen enough. The vision has been met in all airs.
Had enough. Sounds of cities in the evening, and in the sun, and always.
Known enough. The stations of life. — O Sounds and Visions!
Departure in new affection and new noise!

[Mystic]
On the slope of the bank, the angels revolve their woolen robes
In the pastures of steel and emerald.
Meadows of flames leap up...

[Barbarian]
The pavilion of bloody meat on the silk of seas and arctic flowers;
(They do not exist.)
Recovered from the old fanfares of heroism—which still attack our hearts and heads—far from the ancient assassins.

[After the Deluge]
As soon as the idea of the Flood had subsided,
A hare stopped in the clover and swinging flowerbells and said a prayer to the rainbow through the spider's web.

[Phrases]
I have stretched ropes from steeple to steeple;
Garlands from window to window;
Golden chains from star to star,
And I dance.

--- PAUL VERLAINE ---
[Art Poétique]
Music before all things,
And for that prefer the Odd
More vague and soluble in air,
With nothing in it that weighs or poses.

[Autumn Song (Chanson d'automne)]
The long sobs
Of the violins
Of autumn
Wound my heart
With a monotonous
Languor.

[Moonlight (Clair de lune)]
Your soul is a chosen landscape
Where charming masqueraders and bergamaskers go
Playing the lute and dancing and almost
Sad beneath their fantastic disguises.

[Il pleut dans mon coeur]
It rains in my heart
As it rains on the town;
What is this languor
That penetrates my heart?

[Green]
Here are fruits, flowers, leaves, and branches,
And here is my heart which beats only for you.
Do not tear it with your two white hands,
And may the poor thing please your eyes today.

[Sentimental Colloquy]
In the old park, frozen and solitary,
Two forms have just passed by.
Their eyes are dead and their lips are soft,
And one can hardly hear their words.

[My Familiar Dream]
I often have this strange and penetrating dream
Of an unknown woman, whom I love, and who loves me
And who is never, each time, quite the same,
Nor quite another...

[Spleen]
The roses were all red,
The ivy was all black.
Dear, you move your head,
And revive my despair.

[Wisdom (Sagesse)]
The sky is, above the roof,
So blue, so calm!
A tree, above the roof,
Rocks its palm.

[Parsifal]
Parsifal has vanquished the Girls, their gentle babble
and amusing luxuriance—and his slope ascending
towards the Wound... he worships the spear...

--- JULES LAFORGUE ---
[The Winter Coming]
Sentimental blockades! Cargoes from the Levant!
Oh, falling rain! Oh, falling night! Oh, the wind!
All Hallows’ Day, Christmas, and the New Year,
Oh, in the drizzling, all my chimneys...

[Pierrot]
On a neck hidden in stiff lace,
Under a cold mask like the moon,
With eyes of emerald green in a swoon,
Pierrot wanders, leaving no trace.

[Complaint of the King of Thule]
There was a King of Thule,
Whom no one imitated,
Who loved apart, in hiw way,
Only his solitude.

[Complaint of the Moon in the Provinces]
Ah! beautiful Full Moon,
Big like a fortune!
Where are you going, retreat?
Over the river of yellowish silk...

[Lament of the Organist of Notre-Dame de Nice]
The winter sun sets slowly,
Cruel and yellow like a quince,
And my poor heart weeps in silence
Here in the loft, alone and lonely.

[Another Complaint of Lord Pierrot]
Usually, she is the one who begins,
I let her do, being divine!
I look into her eyes, leaning...
And it is the impossible that dominates.

[The Mystery of the Three Horns]
A hunting horn sounds in the woods,
Calling the stag, calling the doe.
But the forest is empty and low,
No one answers, no one understood.

[Solo by Moonlight]
I smoke, facing the night,
My cigarette mimics the fog...
O unbalanced constellations,
J’en ai assez de vos rotations!

[Simple Agony]
Skeptical? No. Believer? No.
I watch the circus of the world.
And death is the only girl
Who really smiles at the end of the show.

[Sunday]
Sunday, Sunday, boring day.
The piano sounds in the street.
Someone plays a waltz, off-beat.
And life passes, grey on grey.

--- TRISTAN CORBIÈRE ---
[The Toad]
A song in a windless night...
Look: under the shadow of the stone,
A toad! —Living gargoyle.
Horror. But look closely:
His eye shines like gold.

[Epitaph]
Mixer of ashes: quack!
He killed himself out of skill...
Too genius to be ugly,
Too ugly to include genius...
A soul? — a stomach!

[Litany of Sleep]
You who snore upon the Just,
Sleep, pure conscience of the unjust!
Sleep, sad lover of the night,
Close the curtain, kill the light.

[Paris by Night]
It’s the sea—calm flat.
And the great tide crying...
It’s not the city—it’s a world
Drowning in the heavy fog curled.

[Insomnia]
Insomnia, impalpable beast!
Is it love? Is it remorse?
That gnaws my brain without divorce?
Why do you visit my poor feast?

[To the Eternal Feminine]
Eternal idol, stupid and vain!
Man pays you with his sweat and pain.
You smile, you paint your lips red,
While ideas die in his head.

[Rondel]
It makes dark in the child's room.
The ghost comes out of the tomb.
Silence. The clock ticks.
Fear plays its old tricks.

[Steam Boat]
Smoke, smoke, little boat!
Dirty the blue sky, dirty the sea.
Man must conquer, man must be
Master of nature, by rote.

[Letter from Mexico]
You ask me if I die?
No, I rot gently under the sun.
Here life and death are one.
Only the flies multiply.

[Cries of theblind]
The eye of stone, the look of lead.
They pass, tapping the ground.
Dead to the light, dead to the sound.
Living tombs among the dead.

--- PAUL VALÉRY ---
[The Cemetery by the Sea (Le Cimetière marin)]
This quiet roof, where doves are walking,
Trembles between the pines, between the tombs;
Just noon composes with its fires
The sea, the sea, always recommencing!
After a thought, O what a reward
Is a long gaze over the calm of gods!

[The Footsteps (Les Pas)]
Your steps, children of my silence,
Saintly, slowly placed,
Towards the bed of my vigilance
Proceed, mute and frozen.
Person, pure shadow, divine presence...

[The Pomegranate]
Hard pomegranates, slightly opening
To yield your seeds in excess,
Assuming the heat of a forehead where a press
Has made the ruby blood burst...

[The Bee]
Whatever stinging, however deadly,
I place my Golden dream on thee;
There is only one thing: to see
The light, whatever the pain be.

[The Spinner]
The garden spins its green and blue,
The thread of water, the web of dew.
I feel the world turning in me,
Sleeping spinner of eternity.

[Palm]
An angel places at my table
Bread, wine, and a simple fruit...
He says nothing, but his wing
Touches my brow in the absolute.

[Helen]
I am the blue of the sea,
I am the white of the foam.
The ships burn for me,
And the heroes never come home.

[Narcissus]
I see myself, I love myself.
The water is my only friend.
In the mirror, without end,
I kiss the lips of myself.

[Interior]
A slave with long eyes charged with molting
Water, milk, the iris, and the rose,
Serves the mirror of my repose
With shadows, secrets, and revolt.

[The Young Fate (La Jeune Parque)]
Who weeps there, if not the simple wind,
At this hour of diamonds alone?
But who weeps, so near to myself,
At the moment of tears unknown?

--- MAURICE MAETERLINCK ---
[Hothouses (Serres chaudes)]
O hothouse in the middle of the woods!
And your doors forever closed!
And all that is under your dome,
And under my soul, in your analogies!

[The Diving Bell]
Blue glass, green water,
Silence surrounds me like a wall.
Strange flowers without perfume
Grow in the garden of the gloom.

[Prayer]
Lord, have pity on my blood,
Have pity on my pale skin.
I am a child of the night,
Afraid of the burning light.

[Ennui]
The peacocks of ennui,
White as the snow,
Walk in the garden of my woe,
Slowly, under the moonless sky.

[Hunt]
My soul is a hunting dog,
Chasing the stag of dreams.
Through the marshes, through the streams,
Lost in the eternal fog.

[Hospital]
The smell of ether and of death.
Rows of beds like white tombs.
Someone sighs with their last breath.
Life ends in these rooms.

[Winter Desires]
I want the ice, the snow, the cold.
To freeze the fever of my brain.
To kill the desire, to kill the pain.
To be a statue, white and old.

[Amen]
So be it. The end is near.
I accept the silence and the fear.
Close the book, blow out the light.
Welcome the long, dark night.

[Songs]
Seven girls of Orlamonde,
When the fairy was dead,
The seven girls of Orlamonde,
Searched for the sun.

[Reflections]
Reflections in the stagnant water.
Faces that I used to know.
Ghosts of days long ago.
Drowning in the muddy slaughter.

--- JEAN MORÉAS ---
[Stanzas (I)]
Leaves of autumn, leaves of red,
You fall like drops of blood.
The tree is naked, the tree is dead.
So is my heart in the mud.

[Stanzas (II)]
The classic form, the rigorous line.
No more vague dreams, no more mist.
I want the marble, I want the wine,
Clear and strong, carefully kissed.

[Stanzas (III)]
Do not tell me of the new.
I love the old, the ancient ways.
The Greek sun, the Roman days.
Everything else is false and untrue.

[Epitaph]
Here lies a poet who tried
To discipline the wild rhyme.
He failed, he suffered, he died.
But he loved beauty in his time.

[The Sea]
The sea is a great sculptor.
It carves the rocks, it shapes the sand.
It holds the world in its hand.
Mighty, cruel, and pure.

[Silence]
Silence is the highest art.
Better than words, better than song.
It speaks directly to the heart,
Where we truly belong.

[Melancholy]
Sweet melancholy, my old friend.
You sit beside me at the fire.
We watch the flames ascend and end.
We have no hope, no desire.

[The Garden]
Order, symmetry, grace.
The trees are trimmed, the paths are straight.
Everything is in its place.
Peaceful, perfect, and sedate.

[Evening]
The sun goes down, the shadows grow.
The day is done, the work is through.
There is nothing left to know.
Only the dark, and me, and you.

[Farewell]
Goodbye to youth, goodbye to love.
I welcome age, and wisdom's cold.
Like a star high above,
Distant, shiny, and old.

--- GUSTAVE KAHN ---
[Nomadic Palaces]
My dream is a palace of clouds,
Floating in the azure sky.
Changing shape as the winds fly,
Far from the noisy crowds.

[Free Verse]
Break the cage, break the bar!
Let the rhythm be free as a bird.
Let every unique emotion be heard.
Follow the music, follow the star.

[Intermezzo]
A moment of pause, a breath.
Between the pain and the joy.
A broken toy, a fading wreath.
Life is a game, death is a boy.

[City]
The city hums, the city screams.
Electric lights, iron wheels.
A monster that never feels.
Eating our souls, eating our dreams.

[Night Watch]
Watching the stars from the roof.
Are they eyes? Are they holes?
Burning diamonds, burning coals.
Silent, distant, and aloof.

[Song of the Gold]
Gold is the king, gold is the lord.
It buys the woman, it buys the sword.
It shines in the dark, it shines in the mud.
It drinks our sweat, it drinks our blood.

[Orient]
Perfumes of amber, silk of red.
Distant lands of sun and spice.
Every pleasure has a price.
Dreams of a harem in my head.

[The White Page]
The terror of the white page.
Waiting for the ink to stain.
To capture the joy, capture the pain.
A silent, empty stage.

[Violin]
The bow cuts the string like a knife.
A cry of wood, a cry of soul.
Making the broken pieces whole.
Music is stronger than life.

[Finale]
The curtain falls, the play is done.
The actors wash their painted face.
Leaving no memory, no trace.
Beneath the setting sun.
