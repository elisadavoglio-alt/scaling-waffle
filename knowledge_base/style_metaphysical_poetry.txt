### 📜 ANTHOLOGY EXAMPLES (GROUND TRUTH)

--- JOHN DONNE ---
[The Flea]
Mark but this flea, and mark in this,
How little that which thou deniest me is;
It sucked me first, and now sucks thee,
And in this flea our two bloods mingled be;
Thou know’st that this cannot be said
A sin, nor shame, nor loss of maidenhead,
    Yet this enjoys before it woo,
    And pampered swells with one blood made of two,
    And this, alas, is more than we would do.

[A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning]
If they be two, they are two so
As stiff twin compasses are two;
Thy soul, the fixed foot, makes no show
To move, but doth, if the other do.
And though it in the center sit,
Yet when the other far doth roam,
It leans and hearkens after it,
And grows erect, as that comes home.

[The Sun Rising]
Busy old fool, unruly sun,
Why dost thou thus,
Through windows, and through curtains call on us?
Must to thy motions lovers' seasons run?
Saucy pedantic wretch, go chide
Late school boys and sour prentices...
She's all states, and all princes, I,
Nothing else is.

[Holy Sonnet 10: Death, be not proud]
Death, be not proud, though some have called thee
Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;
For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow
Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me.
One short sleep past, we wake eternally
And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.

[Holy Sonnet 14: Batter my heart]
Batter my heart, three-person'd God, for you
As yet but knock, breathe, shine, and seek to mend;
That I may rise and stand, o'erthrow me, and bend
Your force to break, blow, burn, and make me new.
Reason, your viceroy in me, me should defend,
But is captiv'd, and proves weak or untrue.

[The Canonization]
For God's sake hold your tongue, and let me love,
Or chide my palsy, or my gout,
My five gray hairs, or ruined fortune flout,
With wealth your state, your mind with arts improve...
The phoenix riddle hath more wit
By us, we two being one, are it.

[The Good-Morrow]
I wonder, by my troth, what thou and I
Did, till we loved? Were we not weaned till then?
But sucked on country pleasures, childishly?
Or snorted we in the seven sleepers’ den?

[Song: Go and catch a falling star]
Go and catch a falling star,
Get with child a mandrake root,
Tell me where all past years are,
Or who cleft the devil's foot.
Teach me to hear mermaids singing,
Or to keep off envy's stinging.

[The Relic]
When my grave is broke up again
Some second guest to entertain...
And he that digs it, spies
A bracelet of bright hair about the bone,
Will he not let me alone?

[Hymn to God the Father]
Wilt thou forgive that sin where I begun,
Which was my sin, though it were done before?
Wilt thou forgive that sin, through which I run,
And do run still, though still I do deplore?
When thou hast done, thou hast not done,
For I have more.

--- GEORGE HERBERT ---
[The Altar]
A broken ALTAR, Lord, thy servant rears,
Made of a heart and cemented with tears;
Whose parts are as thy hand did frame;
No workman's tool hath touch'd the same.
A HEART alone
Is such a stone,
As nothing but
Thy pow'r doth cut.

[Easter Wings]
Lord, who createdst man in wealth and store,
Though foolishly he lost the same,
Decaying more and more,
Till he became
Most poor:
With thee
O let me rise
As larks, harmoniously,
And sing this day thy victories:
Then shall the fall further the flight in me.

[The Pulley]
When God at first made man,
Having a glass of blessings standing by,
"Let us," said he, "pour on him all we can.
Let the world's riches, which dispersed lie,
Contract into a span."
Rest in the bottom lay.
"For if I should," said he,
"Bestow this jewel also on my creature,
He would adore my gifts instead of me."

[Love (III)]
Love bade me welcome. Yet my soul drew back
Guilty of dust and sin.
But quick-eyed Love, observing me grow slack
From my first entrance in,
Drew nearer to me, sweetly questioning,
If I lacked anything.
"You must sit down," says Love, "and taste my meat."
So I did sit and eat.

[The Collar]
I struck the board, and cried, "No more;
I will abroad!
What? shall I ever sigh and pine?
My lines and life are free; free as the road,
Loose as the wind, as large as store."
But as I rav'd and grew more fierce and wild
At every word,
Me thought I heard one calling, Child!
And I replied, My Lord.

[Virtue]
Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright,
The bridal of the earth and sky;
The dew shall weep thy fall to-night,
For thou must die.
Only a sweet and virtuous soul,
Like season'd timber, never gives.

[The Flower]
How fresh, O Lord, how sweet and clean
Are thy returns! ev'n as the flowers in spring;
To which, besides their own demean,
The late-past frosts tributes of pleasure bring.
Grief melts away
Like snow in May,
As if there were no such cold thing.

[Jordan (I)]
Who says that fictions only and false hair
Become a verse? Is there in truth no beauty?
Is all good structure in a winding stair?
May no lines pass, except they do their duty
Not to a true, but painted chair?

[Prayer (I)]
Prayer the church's banquet, angel's age,
God's breath in man returning to his birth,
The soul in paraphrase, heart in pilgrimage,
The Christian plummet sounding heaven and earth.

[Life]
I made a posy, while the day ran by:
Here will I smell my remnant out, and tie
My life within this band.
But Time did beckon to the flowers, and they
By noon most cunningly did steal away,
And wither'd in my hand.

--- ANDREW MARVELL ---
[To His Coy Mistress]
Had we but world enough, and time,
This coyness, lady, were no crime.
We would sit down and think which way
To walk, and pass our long love's day...
But at my back I always hear
Time's winged chariot hurrying near;
And yonder all before us lie
Deserts of vast eternity.
The grave's a fine and private place,
But none I think do there embrace.

[The Garden]
How vainly men themselves amaze
To win the palm, the oak, or bays,
And their uncessant labours see
Crowned from some single herb or tree...
The soul that can
Cast the body's vest,
And here, though like the bird it sits and sings,
Then whets, and combs its silver wings.

[A Dialogue Between the Soul and Body]
SOUL: O who shall, from this dungeon, raise
A soul enslav’d so many ways?
With bolts of bones, that fetter’d stands
In feet; and manacled in hands.
BODY: O who shall me deliver whole
From bonds of this tyrannic soul?
Which, stretch’d upright, impales me so,
That mine own precipice I go.

[The Definition of Love]
My love is of a birth as rare
As 'tis for object strange and high:
It was begotten by despair
Upon impossibility.
Magnanimous despair alone
Could show me so divine a thing.

[The Mower Against Gardens]
Luxurious man, to bring his vice in use,
Did after him the world seduce...
And flowers themselves, were taught to paint.
The tulip, white, did for complexion seek;
And learned to interline its cheek.

[An Horatian Ode upon Cromwell's Return from Ireland]
The forward youth that would appear
Must now forsake his muses dear,
Nor in the shadows sing
His numbers languishing.
'Tis time to leave the books in dust,
And oil th' unused armour's rust.

[Bermudas]
Where the remote Bermudas ride
In the ocean's bosom unespied,
From a small boat, that rowed along,
The listening winds received this song.

[On a Drop of Dew]
See how the orient dew,
Shed from the bosom of the morn
Into the blowing roses,
Yet careless of its mansion new.

[Eyes and Tears]
How wisely Nature did decree,
With the same eyes to weep and see!
That, having viewed the object vain,
We might be ready to complain.

[The Coronet]
When for the thorns with which I long, too long,
With many a piercing wound,
My Savior’s head have crowned,
I seek with garlands to redress that wrong.

--- HENRY VAUGHAN ---
[The World]
I saw Eternity the other night,
Like a great ring of pure and endless light,
All calm, as it was bright;
And round beneath it, Time in hours, days, years,
Driv'n by the spheres
Like a vast shadow mov'd.

[The Retreat]
Happy those early days! when I
Shin'd in my Angel-infancy.
Before I understood this place
Appointed for my second race,
Or taught my soul to fancy ought
But a white, Celestial thought.

[They are all gone into the world of light]
They are all gone into the world of light!
And I alone sit lingering here;
Their very memory is fair and bright,
And my sad thoughts doth clear.

[Peace]
My Soul, there is a country
Far beyond the stars,
Where stands a winged sentry
All skillful in the wars.

[The Waterfall]
With what deep murmurs through time's silent stealth
Doth thy transparent, cool and wat'ry wealth
Here flowing fall,
And chide, and call...

--- RICHARD CRASHAW ---
[The Weeper]
Hail, sister springs!
Parents of silver-footed rills!
Ever bubbling things!
Thawing crystal! snowy hills!
Tears, where the very stars...

[A Hymn to the Name and Honor of the Admirable Saint Teresa]
Love, thou art absolute sole lord
Of life and death. To prove the word,
We'll now appeal to none of all
Those thy old soldiers, great and tall.

[Wishes to His Supposed Mistress]
Whoe'er she be,
That not impossible She
That shall command my heart and me;
Where'er she lie,
Lock'd up from mortal eye,
In shady leaves of destiny.

[On the Water of Our Lord's Baptism (Latin Trans.)]
The conscious water saw its God and blushed.
(Nympha pudica Deum vidit, et erubuit).

[The Flaming Heart]
O Heart! the equal poise of love's both parts
Big alike with wound and darts.
Live in these conquering leaves; live all the same;
And walk through all tongues one triumphant flame.

--- THOMAS TRAHERNE ---
[Wonder]
How like an Angel came I down!
How bright are all things here!
When first among His works I did appear
O how their Glory me did crown!
The world resembled his Eternity,
In which my soul did walk;
And every thing that I did see
Did with me talk.

[Shadows in the Water]
In unexperienc'd Infancy
Many a sweet Mistake
Doth make the Holy Mother's Eye
Weeping for Pity's sake.

[The Salutation]
These little Limbs,
These Eyes and Hands which here I find,
This panting Heart wherewith my Life begins;
Where have ye been? Behind
What Curtain were ye from me hid so long!

[Eden]
A learned and a Happy Ignorance
Divided me...
I knew not that there was a Serpent's Sting,
Whose Poison shed
On Men, did overspread
The World.

[Consummation]
The Thoughts of Men appear
Freely to move within a Sphere
Of endless Reach; and naturally grow
Infinite in their Flow.

--- ABRAHAM COWLEY ---
[The Wish]
Well then! I now do plainly see
This busy world and I shall ne'er agree.
The very honey of all earthly joy
Does of all meats the soonest cloy.

[The Grasshopper]
Happy Insect! what can be
In happiness compared to thee?
Fed with nourishment divine,
The dewy morning's gentle wine!

[The Swap]
If mine eyes do e'er declare
They've seen a second thing that's fair,
Or ears, that they have music found
Besides thy voice, in any sound...

[Beauty]
Beauty, thou wild fantastic ape,
Who dost in every country change thy shape!
Here black, there brown, here tawny, and there white;
Thou flatterer which compliest with every sight!

[Against Hope]
Hope, whose weak being ruined is,
Alike, if it succeed, and if it miss;
Whom good or ill does equally confound,
And both the horns of Fate's dilemma wound.

--- HENRY KING ---
[The Exequy]
Accept, thou shrine of my dead saint,
Instead of dirges, this complaint;
And for sweet flowers to crown thy hearse,
Receive a strew of weeping verse
From thy grieved friend, whom thou might'st see
Quite melted into tears for thee.
Sleep on, my Love, in thy cold bed,
Never to be disquieted!

[Sic Vita]
Like to the falling of a star,
Or as the flights of eagles are,
Or like the fresh spring's gaudy hue,
Or silver drops of morning dew...
So is my life. The wind is blown,
The star is fallen, the eagle flown.

[My Midnight Meditation]
Ill-busied man! why should’st thou take such care
To lengthen out thy life’s short calendar?

[The Legacy]
My dearest Love! since thou wilt go,
And leave me here behind thee,
For love or pity let me know
The place where I may find thee.

[On Two Children, Dying of One Disease]
Brought forth in sorrow, and bred up in care,
Two tender children here laid down are:
One die, the other could not live.

--- LORD HERBERT OF CHERBURY ---
[Ode Upon a Question Moved, Whether Love Should Continue for Ever?]
Having interr'd her Infant-birth,
The wat'ry ground that late did mourn,
Was strew'd with flow'rs for the return
Of the wish'd Bridegroom of the earth.
"Must then," said she, "our love return
To dust, as must its object do?"

[Sonnet of Black Beauty]
Black beauty, which above that common light,
Whose power can no most blackest clouds embrace,
Preferr'st thy dark and hidden inward grace.

[Kissing]
Come hither Womankind and all their worth,
Give me thy kisses as I call them forth.

[Elegy over a Tomb]
Must I then see, alas! eternal night
Sitting upon those fairest eyes,
And closing all those beams, which once did rise
So radiant and bright,
That light and heat in them to us did prove
Knowledge and Love?

[To His Watch, When He Could Not Sleep]
Uncessant minutes, whilst you move you tell
The time that tells our life, which though it run
Never so fast or far, your new begun
Short steps shall overtake.

--- JOHN CLEVELAND ---
[The Rebel Scot]
Come, keen iambics, with your badger's feet
And badger-like bite till the teeth do meet.
Help, ye tart satirists, to imp my rage
With all the scorpions that should whip this age.

[Mark Antony]
When as the nightingale chanted her vespers,
And the wild forester couched on the ground,
Venus invited me in the evening whispers
Unto a fragrant field with roses crowned.

[Fuscara, or The Bee Errant]
Nature’s confectioner, the bee,
(Whose suckets are moist alchimy,
The still of his refining mold
Minting the garden into gold.)

[To the State of Love]
I saw a vision yesternight
Enough to startle all but right.
Political love, it seems, is blind,
Wait, or the state will change its mind.

[On the Memory of Mr. Edward King]
I like not tears in tune, nor do I prize
His artificial grief, who scans his eyes.
Mine weep down pious beads, but lovers' verses
Are like the hired mourners at hearses.

--- THOMAS CAREW ---
[A Rapture]
I will enjoy thee now, my Celia, come
And fly with me to Love's Elysium.
The giant, Honour, that keeps cowards out,
Is but a masquer, and the formal rout
Of ceremonious rites.

[The Spring]
Now that the winter's gone, the earth hath lost
Her snow-white robes, and now no more the frost
Candies the grass, or casts an icy cream
Upon the silver lake or crystal stream.

[Ask me no more where Jove bestows]
Ask me no more where Jove bestows,
When June is past, the fading rose;
For in your beauty's orient deep
These flowers, as in their causes, sleep.

[Mediocrity in Love Rejected]
Give me more love, or more disdain;
The torrid or the frozen zone
Bring equal ease unto my pain,
The temperate affords me none.

[To My Inconstant Mistress]
When thou, poor excommunicate
From all the joys of love, shalt see
The full reward and glorious fate
Which my strong faith shall purchase me,
Then shalt thou curse the fair and cruel maid
That would’ve yielded, but was betrayed.
