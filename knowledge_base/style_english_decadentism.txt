### 📜 ANTHOLOGY EXAMPLES (GROUND TRUTH)

--- OSCAR WILDE ---
[The Sphinx]
In a dim corner of my room for longer than my fancy thinks
A beautiful and silent Sphinx has watched me through the shifting gloom.
Inviolate and immobile she does not rise she does not stir
For silver moons are naught to her and naught to her the suns that reel.

[The Ballad of Reading Gaol]
Yet each man kills the thing he loves,
By each let this be heard,
Some do it with a bitter look,
Some with a flattering word,
The coward does it with a kiss,
The brave man with a sword!

[Impression du Matin]
The Thames nocturne of blue and gold
Changed to a Harmony in grey:
A barge with ochre-coloured hay
Dropt from the wharf: and chill and cold
The yellow fog came down and crept
At bridges till the houses walls
Seemed changed to shadows and St. Paul's
Loomed like a bubble o'er the town.

[Symphony in Yellow]
An omnibus across the bridge
Crawls like a yellow butterfly
And, here and there, a passer-by
Shows like a little restless midge.
Big barges full of yellow hay
Are moored against the shadowy wharf,
And, like a yellow silken scarf,
The thick fog hangs along the quay.

[Helas!]
To drift with every passion till my soul
Is a stringed lute on which all winds can play,
Is it for this that I have given away
Mine ancient wisdom, and austere control?

[The Harlot's House]
We caught the tread of dancing feet,
We loitered down the moonlit street,
And stopped beneath the harlot's house.
Inside, above the din and fray,
We heard the loud musicians play
The 'Treues Liebes Herz' of Strauss.

[Requiescat]
Tread lightly, she is near
Under the snow,
Speak gently, she can hear
The daisies grow.

[Ave Imperatrix]
Set in this stormy Northern sea,
Queen of these restless fields of tide,
England! what shall men say of thee,
Before whose feet the worlds divide?

[Flower of Love]
Sweet, I blame you not, for mine the fault was, had I not been made of common clay
I had climbed the higher heights unclimbed yet, seen the fuller air, the larger day.

[Sonnet on Hearing the Dies Irae Sung in the Sistine Chapel]
Nay, Lord, not thus! white lilies in the spring,
Sad olive-groves, or silver-breasted dove,
Teach me more clearly of Thy life and love
Than terrors of red flame and thundering.

--- ARTHUR SYMONS ---
[Pastel]
The light of our cigarettes
Went and came in the gloom:
It was dark in the little room.
Dark, and then, in the dark,
Sudden, a flash, a glow,
And a hand and a ring I know.

[White Heliotrope]
The feverish room and that white bed,
The tumbled skirts upon a chair,
The novel flung half-open there,
Hat, hair-pins, puffs, and paints, and red...

[Javanese Dancers]
Twitched strings, the clang of metal, beaten drums,
Dull, shrill, continuous, disquieting;
And now the stealthy dancer comes
Undulantly with cat-like steps that cling...

[London Nights]
My life is like a music-hall,
Where, in the impotence of rage,
Chained by enchantment to the stall,
I see myself upon the stage
Dance to amuse a music-hall.

[The Absinthe-Drinker]
Gently I wave the visible world away.
Far off, I hear a roar, afar yet near,
Far off and strange, a voice is in my ear,
And is the voice my own? the words I say?

[Maquillage]
The charm of rouge on fragile cheeks,
Pearl-powder, and, about the eyes,
The dark and lustrous Eastern dyes;
The floating odour that bespeaks
A Muse of fragrance, not of thought...

[Emmy]
Emmy's exquisite youth and her virginal air,
Eyes and teeth in the flash of a musical smile,
Come to me out of the past, and I see her there
As I saw her once for a while.

[Nora on the Pavement]
As Nora on the pavement
Dances, and she entrances the grey hour
Into the laughing circle of her power,
The magic circle of her glances...

[Stella Maris]
The joy of infinite ocean,
The joy of the unquiet earth,
And the joy of the storm's mirth,
And the joy of the stars' motion.

[Credo]
Each moment is a ray of passion, perfect,
Create of its own fervour, and then dead;
And we, the dust and ash of things, are led
By the same law to the same end, wreckt.

--- ERNEST DOWSON ---
[Non Sum Qualis Eram Bonae Sub Regno Cynarae]
Last night, ah, yesternight, betwixt her lips and mine
There fell thy shadow, Cynara! thy breath was shed
Upon my soul between the kisses and the wine;
And I was desolate and sick of an old passion,
Yea, I was desolate and bowed my head:
I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.

[Vitae Summa Brevis Spem Nos Vetat Incohare Longam]
They are not long, the weeping and the laughter,
Love and desire and hate:
I think they have no portion in us after
We pass the gate.

[Dregs]
The fire is out, and spent the warmth thereof,
(This is the end of every song man sings!)
The golden wine is drunk, the dregs remain,
Bitter as wormwood and as salt as pain;
And health and hope have gone the way of love
Into the drear oblivion of lost things.

[Villanelle of the Poet's Road]
Wine and woman and song,
Three things garnish our way:
Yet is day over long.

[Extreme Unction]
Upon the eyes, the lips, the feet,
On all the passages of sense,
The atoning oil is spread with sweet
Renewal of lost innocence.

[Impenitentia Ultima]
Before my light goes out, for ever, if God should give me a choice of graces,
I would not reck of length of days, nor crave for things to be;
But cry: "One day of the great lost days, one face of all the faces,
Grant me to see and touch once more and nothing more to see."

[To One in Bedlam]
With delicate, mad hands, behind his sordid bars,
Surely he hath his posies, which they tear and twine;
Those scentless wisps of straw, that miserably line
His strait, caged universe, whereat the dull world stares.

[Autumnal]
Pale amber sunlight falls across
The reddening October trees,
That hardly sway before a breeze
As soft as summer: summer's loss
Seems little, dear! on days like these.

[Vesperal]
Strange grows the river on the sunless evenings!
The river comforts me, grown spectral, vague and dumb:
Long was the day; at last the consoling shadows come:
Heavily allow the petals of my heart's red rose.

[A Valediction]
If we must part,
Then let it be like this;
Not heart on heart,
Nor with the useless anguish of a kiss;
But touch mine hand and say:
"Until to-morrow or some other day."

--- LIONEL JOHNSON ---
[The Dark Angel]
Dark Angel, with thine aching lust
To rid the world of penitence:
Malicious Angel, who still dost
My soul such subtile violence!
Because of thee, no thought, no thing,
Abides for me undesecrate:
Dark Angel, ever on the wing,
Who never reachest me too late!

[By the Statue of King Charles at Charing Cross]
Comely and calm, he rides
Hard by his own Whitehall:
Only the night wind glides:
No crowds, nor rebels, brawl.

[The Precept of Silence]
I know you: solitary griefs,
Desolate passions, aching hours!
I know you: tremulous beliefs,
Agonized hopes, and ashen flowers!

[Mystic and Cavalier]
Go from me: I am one of those, who fall.
What! hath no cold wind swept your heart at all,
In my sad company? Before the end,
Go from me, dear my friend!

[To a Traveller]
The mountains, and the lonely death at last
Upon the lonely mountains: O the cold!
O the great solitudes and winds of old!
The silence of the earth's eternal past.

[Plato in London]
The pure flame of one taper fall
Over the old and comely page:
No harsh, mocking voice to call
In from the early morning age.

[The Destroyer of a Soul]
I hate you with a necessary hate.
First, I will fight you in your strength: and then,
I will enjoy your weakness: yes, at length,
I will enjoy your weakness and your fate.

[Dead]
In Merioneth, over the sad moor,
Drives the rain, the cold wind blows:
Past the ruinous grey door,
Crying of a dead man's woes.

[Sancta Silvarum]
Deep music of the ancient forest!
Through glades and coverts I move:
And meet the gods, when the day is hoarest
With golden mist in the grove.

[Bagley Wood]
The night is full of stars, full of stars,
And the dark wood of dreams:
But the great Silence, with its iron bars,
Shuts out the world that seems.

--- AUBREY BEARDSLEY ---
[The Three Musicians]
Along the path that skirts the wood,
The three musicians wend their way,
Pleased with their thoughts, each other's mood,
Franz Himmel's latest roundelay,
The morning's work, a new-found theme,
their breakfast and the summer day.

[The Ballad of a Barber]
Here is the tale of Carrousel,
The barber of Meridian Street.
He cut, and coiffed, and shaved so well,
That all the world was at his feet.

[Under the Hill (Dedication)]
To the most noble and beautiful,
The Prince of the Artificial,
The Lover of the Unnatural,
The Priest of the Perverse.

[Catullus]
Catullus! through the thicket of the years,
One hears thy voice, a crystal bell that rings;
One sees thee, with thy loves, thy hates, thy fears,
Thy doves, thy kisses, and thy sufferings.

--- JOHN GRAY ---
[The Flying Fish]
The birds that fly, the fish that swim,
In the blue water and the air,
Content them with the portion there
That falls to each of them.

[Mishka]
Mishka is poet among the beasts.
The lion is the poet of the East.
The bear explains the North. The West
Is interpreted by the eagle's breast.

[Poem]
Geranium, houseleek, laid in oblong beds
On the trim grass. The daisies'leprous stain
Is fresh. Each night the daisies burst again,
Though every day the gardener crops their heads.

[Femmes Damnées]
Like cattle in a pen the women lie,
Their eyes are fixed and hard, and full of hate;
They wait, and watching, do not seem to wait,
Staring with eyes that see not at the sky.

[Les Demoiselles de Sauve]
Beautiful ladies through the orchard pass;
Bend under crutched-boughs, lashed with dying green;
Pave with their rustling skirts the grass;
Scent the faint morning air with Moreen.

--- THEODORE WRATISLAW ---
[Orchids]
Orange and purple, shot with white and gold,
They swoon in heavy odours where they lie,
Like eyes of strange sins that I might behold
And die.

[The Music-Hall]
The curtain falls. The music plays.
The audience claps and shouts its praise.
The painted women on the stage
Bow and retire, the pets of the age.

[Hothouse Flowers]
I hate the flowers of the field, the grass,
The simple lilies and the roses red.
Give me the orchids in their house of glass,
Where strange and subtle scents are shed.

[Palm Sunday]
The palms are green in the church to-day,
But the hearts of men are dry and grey.
We sing Hosanna with lips of clay,
But our souls are far away.

[Satiety]
I am tired of passion and of pain,
Of the fever that burns in the blood.
I long for the cool and the gentle rain,
And the silence of the wood.

--- OLIVE CUSTANCE ---
[The White Statue]
I love you, silent statue! for your sake
My songs are heavy with a vague desire.
I want to touch your hands and feet and make
Your cold white body kindle into fire.

[Peacocks]
In gorgeous plumage, azure, gold and green,
They trample the pale flowers, and their shrill cry
Rends the blue air...

[Opals]
My soul is like an opal,
All grey and blue and green,
With moving fires of ruby
And flashes of unseen.

[Twilight]
The day is dead, and the night is dying,
And the world is grey and cold.
Only the wind is crying, crying,
Like a lost child on the wold.

[Doubts]
Do you love me? I ask the question
Of the silence and the stars.
But they give me no suggestion,
Only the night with its bars.

--- LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS ---
[Two Loves]
"I am true Love, I fill
The hearts of boy and girl with mutual flame."
Then sighing said the other, "Have thy will,
I am the Love that dare not speak its name."

[The Dead Poet (On Wilde)]
I dreamed of him last night, I saw his face
All radiant and unshadowed of distress,
And as of old, in music measureless,
I heard his golden voice and marked him trace
Under the common thing the hidden grace.

[Impression de Nuit]
See what a mass of gems the city wears
Upon her broad night-bosom! row on row
Rubies and emeralds and amethysts glow.
See! that huge circle like a necklace, stares...

[Rejected]
If I had been a king and you a queen,
We might have walked in majesty and pride.
But I am poor and you are poor, I ween,
So we must walk in silence side by side.

[Plainte Eternelle]
The sun sinks down into the sea,
The night comes up the sky.
My heart is sad for memory
Of days that go not by.

--- MICHAEL FIELD (KATHERINE BRADLEY & EDITH COOPER) ---
[La Gioconda]
Historic, side-long, implicating eyes;
A smile of velvet's lustre on the cheek;
Calm lips the smile leads upward; hand that lies
Glowing and soft, the patience in its rest
Of cruelty that waits and doth not seek.

[Cyclamens]
They are terribly white,
There is snow on the ground,
And a moon on the snow at night;
The sky is cut by the winter light;
Yet I, who have all these things, have found
Suddenly back in my heart the sound
Of a day that was dead.

[A Dyer]
I love the dyer's art,
To dip the white wool in the vat,
And watch the colour start
And spread, and make the old new.

[Sweeter Far]
Sweeter far than the rose
Is the lily that blows
In the valley of dreams.

[Constancy]
I love her with a love that cannot die.
It is the sun that lights my winter sky.
It is the star that guides me through the night.
It is my strength, my glory, and my light.
