### 📜 ANTHOLOGY EXAMPLES (GROUND TRUTH)

--- SYLVIA PLATH ---
[Lady Lazarus]
Dying
Is an art, like everything else.
I do it exceptionally well.
I do it so it feels like hell.
I do it so it feels real.
I guess you could say I’ve a call.

[Daddy]
You do not do, you do not do
Any more, black shoe
In which I have lived like a foot
For thirty years, poor and white,
Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.

[Daddy]
At twenty I tried to die
And get back, back, back to you.
I thought even the bones would do.
But they pulled me out of the sack,
And they stuck me together with glue.

[Ariel]
Stasis in darkness.
Then the substanceless blue
Pour of tor and distances.
God’s lioness,
How one we grow,
Pivot of heels and knees...

[Tulips]
The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.
Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.
I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly
As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.

[The Applicant]
First, are you our sort of a person?
Do you wear
A glass eye, false teeth or a crutch,
A brace or a hook,
Rubber breasts or a rubber crotch,
Stitches to show something's missing?

[Edge]
The woman is perfected.
Her dead
Body wears the smile of accomplishment,
The illusion of a Greek necessity
Flows in the scrolls of her toga.

[Morning Song]
Love set you going like a fat gold watch.
The midwife slapped your footsoles, and your bald cry
Took its place among the elements.

[Cut]
What a thrill —
My thumb instead of an onion.
The top quite gone
Except for a sort of a hinge
Of skin...

[Mad Girl's Love Song]
I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead;
I lift my lids and all is born again.
(I think I made you up inside my head.)
The stars go waltzing out in blue and red.

--- ANNE SEXTON ---
[Her Kind]
I have gone out, a possessed witch,
haunting the black air, braver at night;
dreaming evil, I have done my hitch
over the plain houses, light by light:
lonely thing, twelve-fingered, out of mind.
A woman like that is not a woman, quite.
I have been her kind.

[The Truth the Dead Know]
Gone, I say and walk from church,
refusing the stiff procession to the grave,
letting the dead ride alone in the hearse.
It is June. I am tired of being brave.

[Wanting to Die]
Since you ask, most days I cannot remember.
I walk in my clothing, unmarked by that voyage.
Then the almost unnameable lust returns.
Even then I have nothing against life.
I know well the grass blades you mention,
the furniture you have placed under the sun.

[Unknown Girl in the Maternity Ward]
Child, the current of your breath is six days long.
You lie, a small knuckle on my white bed;
lie, fisted like a snail, so small and strong
at my breast. Your lips are animals; you are fed...

[The Double Image]
I am thirty this November.
You are still small, in your fourth year.
We stand watching the yellow leaves go queer,
flapping in the winter rain...

[Menstruation at Forty]
I was thinking of a son.
The womb is not a clock
or a bell tolling,
but in the eleventh month of its life
I feel the November
of the body as well as of the calendar.

[Cinderella]
You always read about it:
the plumber with twelve children
who wins the Irish Sweepstakes.
From toilets to riches.
That story.

[Little Girl, My String Bean, My Lovely Woman]
My daughter, at eleven
(almost twelve), is like a garden.
Oh, darling! Born in that sweet birthday suit
and having owned it and known it for so long...

[45 Mercy Street]
In my dream,
drilling into the marrow
of my entire bone,
my real dream,
I'm walking up and down Beacon Hill
searching for a street sign...

[Self in 1958]
What is reality?
I am a plaster doll; I pose
with eyes that cut open without fanfare
or dismiss.

--- ROBERT LOWELL ---
[Skunk Hour]
Nautilus Island’s hermit
heiress still lives through winter in her Spartan cottage;
her sheep still graze above the sea.
Her son’s a bishop. Her farmer
is first selectman in our village;
she’s in her dotage.

[Skunk Hour]
One dark night,
my Tudor Ford climbed the hill's skull;
I watched for love-cars. Lights turned down,
they lay together, hull to hull,
where the graveyard shelves on the town...
My mind's not right.

[For the Union Dead]
The old South Boston Aquarium stands
in a Sahara of snow now. Its broken windows are boarded.
The bronze weathervane cod has lost half its scales.
The airy tanks are dry.

[Memories of West Street and Lepke]
Only teaching on Tuesdays, book-worming
in pajamas fresh from the washer each morning,
I hog a whole house on Boston's
"hardly passionate Marlborough Street"...

[Home After Three Months Away]
Gone now the baby's nurse,
a lioness who ruled the roost
and made the Mother cry.
She used to tie
gobbets of porkrind in bowknots of gauze...

[Man and Wife]
Tamed by Miltown, we lie on Mother's bed;
the rising sun in war paint dyes us red;
in broad daylight her gilded bed-posts shine,
abandoned, almost Dionysian.

[The Quaker Graveyard in Nantucket]
A brackish reach of shoal off Madaket,—
The sea was still breaking violently and night
Had steamed into our North Atlantic Fleet,
When the drowned sailor clutched the drag-net.

[To Speak of Woe That Is in Marriage]
"It is the future generation that presses into being by means of these exuberant feelings and supersensible soap bubbles of ours."
The hot night makes us keep our bedroom windows open.
Our magnolia blossoms. Life begins to happen.

[Waking in the Blue]
The night attendant, a B.U. sophomore,
rouses from the mare's-nest of his drowsy head
propped on The Meaning of Meaning.
He catwalks down our corridor.
Azure day
makes my agonized blue window bleaker.

[Eye and Tooth]
My whole eye was sunset red,
the old cut cornea throbbed,
I saw things darkly,
as through an unwashed goldfish globe.

--- JOHN BERRYMAN ---
[Dream Song 14]
Life, friends, is boring. We must not say so.
After all, the sky flashes, the great sea yearns,
we ourselves flash and yearn,
and moreover my mother told me as a boy
(repeatingly) ‘Ever to confess you’re bored
means you have no Inner Resources.’

[Dream Song 1]
Huffy Henry hid the day,
unappeasable Henry sulked.
I see his point,—a trying to put things over.
It was the thought that they thought
they could do it made Henry wicked & away.
But he should have come out and talked.

[Dream Song 4]
There sat down, once, a thing on Henry's heart
só heavy, if he had a hundred years
& more, & weeping, sleepless, in all them time
Henry could not make good.

[Dream Song 29]
There sat down, once, a thing on Henry's heart
só heavy, if he had a hundred years
& more, & weeping, sleepless, in all them time
Henry could not make good.
Starts again always in Henry's ears
the little cough somewhere, an odour, a chime.

[Dream Song 76: Henry's Confession]
Nothin very bad happen to me lately.
How you explain that? — I explain that, Mr Bones,
terms o' your bafflin odd sobriety.
Sobriety & fastin play the devil
with a man's pleasantries.

[Dream Song 384]
The marker slants, flowerless, day's almost done,
I stand above my father's grave with rage,
often, often before
I've made this awful pilgrimage to one
who cannot visit me, who tore his page
out: I come back for more.

[Dream Song 382]
At Henry's bier let some thing fall out well:
enter there none who somewhat has to sell,
the music ancient & the flowers few.

[The Ball Poem]
What is the boy now, who has lost his ball,
What, what is he to do? I saw it go
Merrily bouncing, down the street, and then
Merrily over—there it is in the water!

[Homage to Mistress Bradstreet]
The Governor your husband lived so long
moved you not, restless, waiting for him?
Still, you were a patient woman.
I love you, Anne.

[Winter Landscape]
The three men, coming down the winter hill
In brown and red and narrow green—
and some dogs, like a black splash on the snow,
and a black splash on the snow.

--- W.D. SNODGRASS ---
[Heart's Needle, 1]
Child of my winter, born
When the new fallen soldiers froze
In open field, and snow
Glazed all the stiffened stalks
And the brown cattails.

[Heart's Needle, 2]
Late April and you are three; today
We dug your garden in the park.
To ease the paths that your small feet
Have worn for you,
I spaded up the bed using a fork.

[Mementos, 1]
Sorting out letters and piles of my old
Cancelled checks, old clippings, and yellow note cards
That meant something once, I happened to find
Your picture. That picture. I stopped there cold.

[Mementos, 2]
I found them there today in the attic
Under some old clothes: two braids of hair
She'd saved from the time she was a girl...

[April Inventory]
The green catalpa tree has turned
All white; the cherry blooms once more.
In one whole year I haven’t learned
A blessed thing they pay you for.

[The Campus on the Hill]
Up the reputable walks of old established trees
They stalk, children of the nouveaux riches.
Chimes
Of the tall Clock Tower drench their heads in glees
Of a championship football team.

[The Examination]
Under the thick beams of that swirly smoking light,
The black robes are methodically pacing..

[Leaving the Motel]
Outside, the last kids on a school bus
Are waving. It gets late.
We must get going now, write
our names in the guest book and pay.

[Viewing the Body]
I saw the light
Of the sun, the moon, and the stars
Go out, and the cars
Go by effectively.

[A Flat One]
Old Fritz, on this rotating bed
For seven wasted months you lay
Dying piecemeal in that dead
Grayish pyjamas.

--- THEODORE ROETHKE ---
[My Papa's Waltz]
The whiskey on your breath
Could make a small boy dizzy;
But I hung on like death:
Such waltzing was not easy.

[The Lost Son]
At Woodlawn I heard the dead cry:
I was lulled by the slamming of iron,
A slow drip over stones,
Toads brooding wells.

[Cuttings]
Sticks-in-a-drowsy-droop seem to lean;
In-between floating bodies of green,
Loll-loll,
They’re sleeping.

[Cuttings (later)]
This urge, wrestle, resurrection of dry sticks,
Cut stems struggling to put down feet,
What saint strained so much,
Rose on such lopped limbs to a new life?

[Root Cellar]
Nothing would sleep in that cellar, dank as a ditch,
Bulbs broke out of boxes hunting for chinks in the dark,
Shoots dangled and drooped,
Lolling obscenely from mildewed crates.

[The Waking]
I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.
I feel my fate in what I cannot fear.
I learn by going where I have to go.

[Elegy for Jane]
I remember the neckcurls, limp and damp as tendrils;
And her quick look, a sidelong pickerel smile;
And how, once startled into talk, the light syllables leaped for her,
And she balanced in the delight of her thought...

[In a Dark Time]
In a dark time, the eye begins to see,
I meet my shadow in the deepening shade;
I hear my echo in the echoing wood—
A lord of nature weeping to a tree.

[The Geranium]
When I put her out, once, by the garbage pail,
She looked so limp and bedraggled,
So foolish and trusting, like a sick poodle,
Or a wizened aster in late September.

[Wish for a Young Wife]
My lizard, my lively writher,
May your limbs never wither,
May the eyes in your face
Survive the green ice
Of envy's mean gaze.

--- DELMORE SCHWARTZ ---
[In Dreams Begin Responsibilities]
I think it is the year 1909. 
I feel as if I were in a motion picture theatre, 
the long arm of the light crossing the darkness and spinning, 
my eyes fixed on the screen.

[The Heavy Bear Who Goes With Me]
The heavy bear who goes with me,
A manifold honey to smear his face,
Clumsy and lumbering here and there,
The central ton of every place...

[Calmly We Walk through This April’s Day]
Calmly we walk through this April’s day,
Metropolitan poetry here and there,
In the park sit pauper and rentier,
The screaming children, the motor-car
Fugitive about us, staying...

[Tired and Unhappy, You Think of Houses]
Tired and unhappy, you think of houses
Soft-carpeted and warm in the December evening,
While snow’s white weight on the roof, in the driving dark...

[Starlight Like Intuition Pierced the Twelve]
The starlight like intuition pierced the twelve,
The brittle night sky sparkled like a tune
Lapped round the world...

[Baudelaire]
When I fall asleep, and even during sleep,
I hear, quite plainly, voices speaking...

[Socrates' Ghost Must Haunt Me Now]
Socrates' ghost must haunt me now,
Not only the old bad life,
But the questions that he asked
About the nature of the good and bad...

[For the One Who Would Not Take His Life in His Hands]
Athlete, virtuoso,
Training for happiness,
Bend your knees, springing up and down...

[A Dog Named Ego]
A dog named Ego, the snowflakes as kisses
Fluttered, ran, came with me in all weathers,
Trotted, side-stepped, hairy...

[Seurat's Sunday Afternoon along the Seine]
What are they looking at?
Is it the river?
The sun?
The eternity of Sunday?

--- RANDALL JARRELL ---
[The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner]
From my mother’s sleep I fell into the State,
And I hunched in its belly till my wet fur froze.
Six miles from earth, loosed from its dream of life,
I woke to black flak and the nightmare fighters.
When I died they washed me out of the turret with a hose.

[The Woman at the Washington Zoo]
The saris go by me from the embassies.
Cloth from the moon. Cloth from another planet.
They look back at the leopard like the leopard.
And I...
this print of mine, that has kept its color
Alive through so many cleanings...

[Next Day]
Moving from Cheer to Joy, from Joy to All,
I take a box
And add it to my wild rice, my Cornish game hens.
The slacked or shorted, basketed, identical
Food-gathering flocks
Are selves I overlook.

[90 North]
At home, in my flannel gown, like a bear to its floe,
I clambered to bed; up the globe's impossible sides
 I sailed all night—till at last, with a week of my life,
I was found and taken home.

[Losses]
It was not dying: everybody died.
It was not dying: we had died before
In the routine crashes--and our fields
Called up the papers, wrote home to our folks...

[The Lost World]
On my way home, I pass a cameraman
On a platform on the bumper of a car
Shooting the Hollywood Boulevard Christmas Parade.

[Eighth Air Force]
If, in an odd angle of the hutment,
A puppy laps the water from a can
Of flowers, and the drunk sergeant shaving
Whistles O Paradiso!...

[The Elementary Scene]
Looking back in my mind I can see
The white sun like a tin plate
Over the wooden turning of the weeds;
And the street jerking like a fiddle-string...

[A Camp in the Prussian Forest]
I walk beside the prisoners to the road.
Load on puffed load,
Their corpses, stacked like sodden wood,
Lie barred or galled with blood...

[Thinking of the Lost World]
This spoonful of chocolate tapioca
Tastes like—like the vanilla, chocolate, strawberry
Ice-cream cone I bought when I was six...

--- ELIZABETH BISHOP ---
[One Art]
The art of losing isn’t hard to master;
so many things seem filled with the intent
to be lost that their loss is no disaster.

[The Fish]
I caught a tremendous fish
and held him beside the boat
half out of water, with my hook
fast in a corner of his mouth.
He didn't fight.
He hadn't fought at all.

[In the Waiting Room]
In Worcester, Massachusetts,
I went with Aunt Consuelo
to keep her dentist’s appointment
and sat and waited for her
in the dentist’s waiting room.

[Sestina]
September rain falls on the house.
In the failing light, the old grandmother
sits in the kitchen with the child
beside the Little Marvel Stove...

[The Moose]
For a moment longer,
by craning backward,
the moose can be seen
on the moonlit macadam;
then there's a dim
smell of moose, an acrid
smell of gasoline.

[Filling Station]
Oh, but it is dirty!
—this little filling station,
oil-soaked, oil-permeated
to a disturbing, over-all
black translucency.
Be careful with that match!

[Questions of Travel]
There are too many waterfalls here; the crowded streams
hurry too rapidly down to the sea,
and the pressure of so many clouds on the mountaintops
makes them spill over the sides...

[At the Fishhouses]
Although it is a cold evening,
down by one of the fishhouses
an old man sits netting,
his net, in the gloaming almost invisible...

[The Armadillo]
This is the time of year
when almost every night
the frail, illegal fire balloons appear.
Climbing the mountain height...

[Sandpiper]
The roaring alongside he takes for granted,
and that every so often the world is bound to shake.
He runs, he runs to the south, finical, awkward,
in a state of controlled panic...

--- SHARON OLDS ---
[The Father]
I have not been able to forgive my father
for his face, for the look in his eyes
when he watched me.

[I Go Back to May 1937]
I see them standing at the formal gates of their colleges,
I see my father strolling out
under the ochre sandstone arch...
I want to go up to them and say Stop,
don't do it—she's the wrong woman,
he's the wrong man...

[The Language of the Brag]
I have wanted excellence in the knife-throw,
I have wanted to use my exceptionally strong and accurate arms
and my straight spine...

[Stag's Leap]
The worst thing in the world
is the pain of the stag
when the hunter brings him down.

[Sex Without Love]
How do they do it, the ones who make love
without love? Beautiful as dancers,
gliding over each other like ice-skaters...

[The Race]
When I got to the airport I rushed up to the desk
and they told me the flight was cancelled.
The doctors had said my father would not live
through the night...

[Ecstasy]
As we made love for the third day,
clouded with the sperm of the dead
and the milk of the living...

[The Death of Marilyn Monroe]
The ambulance men touched her cold
body, lifted it, heavy as iron,
onto the stretcher, tried to close the
mouth, closed the eyes...

[Topography]
After we flew across the country we
got in bed, laid our bodies
delicately together, like maps laid
face to face...

[Fate]
Then I knew that I had been right
not to worry when his train was late.
I knew that he would come back.
