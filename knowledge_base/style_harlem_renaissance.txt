### 📜 ANTHOLOGY EXAMPLES (GROUND TRUTH)

--- LANGSTON HUGHES ---
[The Negro Speaks of Rivers]
I've known rivers:
I've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the
     flow of human blood in human veins.
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

[I, Too]
I, too, sing America.
I am the darker brother.
They send me to eat in the kitchen
When company comes,
But I laugh,
And eat well,
And grow strong.

[The Weary Blues]
Droning a drowsy syncopated tune,
Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,
     I heard a Negro play.
Down on Lenox Avenue the other night
By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light
     He did a lazy sway...

[Harlem]
What happens to a dream deferred?
      Does it dry up
      like a raisin in the sun?
      Or fester like a sore—
      And then run?

[Mother to Son]
Well, son, I’ll tell you:
Life for me ain’t been no crystal stair.
It’s had tacks in it,
And splinters,
And boards torn up,
And places with no carpet on the floor—
Bare.

[Dream Variations]
To fling my arms wide
In some place of the sun,
To whirl and to dance
Till the white day is done.
Then rest at cool evening
Beneath a tall tree
While night comes on gently,
   Dark like me—
That is my dream!

[Cross]
My old man’s a white old man
And my old mother’s black.
If ever I cursed my white old man
I take my curses back.

[Jazzonia]
Oh, silver tree!
Oh, shining rivers of the soul!
In a Harlem cabaret
Six long-headed jazzers play.
A dancing girl whose eyes are bold
Lifts high a dress of silken gold.

[Theme for English B]
I guess being colored doesn't make me not like
the same things other folks like who are other races.
So will my page be colored that I write?
Being me, it will not be white.

[Afro-American Fragment]
So long,
So far away
Is Africa.
Not even memories alive
Save those that history books create,
Save those that songs
Beat back into the blood—

--- CLAUDE MCKAY ---
[If We Must Die]
If we must die, let it not be like hogs
Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot,
While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs,
Making their mock at our accursed lot.
If we must die, O let us nobly die...

[America]
Although she feeds me bread of bitterness,
And sinks into my throat her tiger’s tooth,
Stealing my breath of life, I will confess
I love this cultured hell that tests my youth!

[The Tropics in New York]
Bananas ripe and green, and ginger-root,
Cocoa in pods and alligator pears,
And tangerines and mangoes and grape fruit,
Fit for the highest prize at parish fairs...

[Harlem Shadows]
I hear the halting footsteps of a lass
In Negro Harlem when the night lets fall
Its veil. I see the shapes of girls who pass
To bend and barter at desire’s call.

[The White City]
I will not toy with it nor bend an inch.
Deep in the secret chambers of my heart
I muse my life-long hate, and without flinch
I bear it nobly as I live my part.

[Outcast]
For the dim regions whence my fathers came
My spirit, bondaged by the body, longs.
Words felt, but never heard, my lips would frame;
My soul would sing forgotten jungle songs.

[Enslaved]
Oh when I think of my long-suffering race,
For weary centuries despised, oppressed,
Enslaved and lynched, denied a human place
In the great life line of the Christian West...

[Subway Wind]
Far down, down through the city's great, gaunt gut
The gray train rushing bears the weary wind;
In the packed cars the fans the crowd's breath cut,
Leaving the sick and heavy air behind.

[After the Winter]
Some day, when trees have shed their leaves
And against the morning’s white
The shivering birds beneath the eaves
Have sheltered for the night...

[To the White Fiends]
Think you I am not fiend and savage too?
Think you I could not arm me with a gun
And shoot down ten of you for every one
Of my black brothers murdered, burnt by you?

--- COUNTEE CULLEN ---
[Yet Do I Marvel]
I doubt not God is good, well-meaning, kind,
And did He stoop to quibble could tell why
The little buried mole continues blind,
Why flesh that mirrors Him must some day die...
Yet do I marvel at this curious thing:
To make a poet black, and bid him sing!

[Heritage]
What is Africa to me:
Copper sun or scarlet sea,
Jungle star or jungle track,
Strong bronzed men, or regal black
Women from whose loins I sprang
When the birds of Eden sang?

[Incident]
Once riding in old Baltimore,
Heart-filled, head-filled with glee,
I saw a Baltimorean
Keep looking straight at me.
Now I was eight and very small,
And he was no whit bigger,
And so I smiled, but he poked out
His tongue, and called me, "Nigger."

[From the Dark Tower]
We shall not always plant while others reap
The golden increment of bursting fruit,
Not always countenance, abject and mute,
That lesser men should hold their brothers cheap.

[Tableau]
Locked arm in arm they cross the way,
The black boy and the white,
The golden splendor of the day,
The sable pride of night.

[Saturday's Child]
Some are teethed on a silver spoon,
With the stars strung for a rattle;
I cut my teeth as the black raccoon—
For implements of battle.

[Simon the Cyrenian Speaks]
He never spoke a word to me,
And yet He called my name;
He never gave a sign to me,
And yet I knew and came.

[A Brown Girl Dead]
With two white roses on her breasts,
White candles at her head,
Dark Madonna of the grave sho rests;
Lord Death has found her sweet.

[Karenge ya Marenge]
I have no other prayer to make,
No other choice to choose;
I keep for my own spirit's sake
What I must win or lose.

[Fruit of the Flower]
My father is a quiet man
With sober, steady ways;
For toddler and for teetotal clan
He has a holy praise.

--- JEAN TOOMER ---
[Georgia Dusk]
The sky, lazily disdaining to pursue
The setting sun, too indolent to hold
A lengthened tournament for flashing gold,
Passively darkens for night’s barbecue.

[Fern]
Face flowed into her eyes. Flowed in soft cream foam and plenteous ripples; in such a way that wherever your glance may momentarily have rested, it immediately thereafter wavered in the direction of her eyes.

[Portrait in Georgia]
Hair—braided chestnut,
coiled like a lynxer’s rope,
Eyes—fagots,
Lips—old scars, or the first red blisters,
Breath—the last sweet scent of cane,
And her slim body, white as the ash
of black flesh after flame.

[Song of the Son]
Pour O pour that parting soul in song,
O pour it in the sawdust glow of night,
Into the velvet pine-smoke air to-night,
And let the valley carry it along.

[Cotton Song]
Come, brother, come. Lets lift it;
Come now, hewit! roll away!
Shackles fall upon the Judgment Day!
But lets not wait for it.

[November Cotton Flower]
Boll-weevil’s coming, and the winter’s cold,
Made cotton-stalks look rusty, seasons old,
And cotton, scarce as any southern snow,
Was vanishing; the branch, so pinched and slow...

[Reapers]
Black reapers with the sound of steel on stones
Are sharpening scythes. I see them place the hones
In their hip-pockets as a thing that's done,
And start their silent swinging, one by one.

[Storm Ending]
Thunder blossoms gorgeously above our heads,
Great, hollow, bell-like flowers,
Rumbling in the wind,
Stretching clappers to strike our ears...

[Beehive]
Within this black hive to-night
There swarm a million bees;
Bees passing in and out the moon,
Bees escaping out the moon,
Bees returning through the moon...

[Harvest Song]
I am a reaper whose muscles set at sundown.
All my oats are cradled.
But I am too chilled, and too fatigued to bind them.
And I hunger.

--- JAMES WELDON JOHNSON ---
[The Creation]
And God stepped out on space,
And he looked around and said:
I'm lonely—
I'll make me a world.

[Go Down Death]
Weep not, weep not,
She is not dead;
She's resting in the bosom of Jesus.
Heart-broken husband—weep no more;
Grief-stricken son—weep no more;
Left-lonesome daughter—weep no more;
She's only just gone home.

[Lift Every Voice and Sing]
Lift every voice and sing
Till earth and heaven ring,
Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;
Let our rejoicing rise
High as the listening skies,
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.

[My City]
But, ah! Manhattan's sights and sounds, her smells,
Her crowds, her throbbing force, the thrill that comes
From being of her a part, her subtle spells,
Her shining towers, her avenues, her slums—
O God! the stark, unutterable pity,
To be dead, and never again behold my city!

[O Black and Unknown Bards]
O black and unknown bards of long ago,
How came your lips to touch the sacred fire?
How, in your darkness, did you come to know
The power and beauty of the minstrel's lyre?

[The Prodigal Son]
Young man—
Young man—
Your arm’s too short to box with God.

[Fifty Years]
With hope and faith we wait the day
When all men shall be truly free,
When 'might is right' shall pass away
And justice rules the land and sea.

[Brothers]
See! There he stands; not brave, but with an air
Of sullen stupor. Mark him well! Is he
Not more like brute beast than a man?

[Sence You Went Away]
Seems lak to me de stars don't shine so bright,
Seems lak to me de sun done loss his light,
Seems lak to me der's nothin' goin' right,
Sence you went away.

[Before a Painting]
I stood before a painting high and dim,
Whereon the master’s hand had traced a face,
A face of sorrow, yet of peace and grace.

--- GEORGIA DOUGLAS JOHNSON ---
[The Heart of a Woman]
The heart of a woman goes forth with the dawn,
As a lone bird, soft winging, so restlessly on,
Afar o’er life’s turrets and vales does it roam
In the wake of those echoes the heart calls home.

[Bronze]
These children of the sun,
These bronze men,
Soft-voiced and laughter-bred,
Are we not kin to them?

[Common Dust]
And who shall separate the dust
What later we shall be:
Whose keen discerning eye will scan
And solve the mystery?

[I Want to Die While You Love Me]
I want to die while you love me,
While yet you hold me fair,
While laughter lies upon my lips
And lights are in my hair.

[My Little Dreams]
I’m folding up my little dreams
Within my heart tonight,
And praying I may soon forget
The torture of their sight.

[Youth]
The dew is on the grasses, dear,
The blush is on the rose,
And swift across our dial-youth,
A shifting shadow goes.

[Smothered Fires]
A woman with a burning flame
Deep covered through the years
With ashes. Ah! she hid it deep,
And smothered it with tears.

[Prejudice]
These fell miasmic rings of mist,
with ghoulish menace bound,
Like noose-horizons tightening
my little world around.

[Calling Dreams]
The right to make my dreams come true,
I ask, nay, I demand of life;
Nor shall fate's deadly contraband
Impede my steps, nor countermand.

[Cosmopolite]
Not wholly this or that,
But every land a part,
Of my diversity.

--- ANNE SPENCER ---
[Lady, Lady]
Lady, Lady, I saw your face,
Dark as night withholding a star...
The chisel fell, or it might have been
You had borne so long the yoke of men.

[Dunbar]
Ah, how poets sing and die!
Make one song and Heaven takes it;
Have one heart and Beauty breaks it;
Chatterton, Shelley, Keats and I—
Ah, how poets sing and die!

[White Things]
Most things are colorful things—
The sky, earth, and sea.
Black men are most men;
But the white are free!
White things are rare things;
White things are desired things.

[Translation]
We trekked into a far country,
My friend and I.
Our deeper content was never spoken,
But each knew all the other said.

[Letter to My Sister]
It is dangerous for a woman to defy the gods;
To taunt them with the tongue's thin tip,
Or strut in the weakness of mere humanity:
The gods adore the obvious.

[At the Carnival]
Gay little Girl-of-the-Diving-Tank,
I desire a name for you,
Nice, as a right direction,
And I like your white-teeth laughter.

[Lines to a Nasturtium]
A lover musing on his belovèd...
Flame-flower, Day-torch, Mauna Loa,
I saw a daring bee, today, pause, and soar,
Into your chalice, yellow as a yolk.

[Before the Feast at Shushan]
Garden of Shushan!
After Eden, all terrace, pool, and flower anew;
With your feasting vases in the casement line,
And the trellis-pattern of your winds.

[Transformation]
We are the spirit of the sun;
We are the pulse of the sea.
The earth is our flesh and bone;
The air is our breath and plea.

[Grapes: Still-Life]
Look at the purple grapes,
Heavy and round and sweet;
They are the wine of life,
Crushed by the dancer's feet.

--- GWENDOLYN BENNETT ---
[To a Dark Girl]
I love you for your brownness,
And the rounded darkness of your breast,
I love you for the breaking sadness
In your voice and shadows where your wayward eyelids rest.

[Heritage]
I want to see the slim palm-trees,
Pulling at the clouds
With little pointed fingers...
I want to see lithe Negro girls
Etched dark against the sky.

[Hatred]
I shall hate you
Like a dart of singing steel
Shot through still air
At even-tide.

[Sonnet 1]
He came in silvern armor, trimmed with black—
A lover come from legends long ago—
With silver spurs and silk upon his back,
And I, the maid who sought to make him know.

[Sonnet 2]
Some things are very dear to me—
Such things as flowers bathed by rain
Or patterns traced upon the sea
Or crocuses where snow has lain.

[Quatrains]
Brushes and paints are all I have
To speak the music in my soul—
While silent shadows creep across
The canvas of my self-control.

[Moon Tonight]
The moon tonight is a silver coin
Dropped in a pool of lead;
And the stars are little sparks
Struck from the anvil of the dead.

[Street Lamps in Early Spring]
Night wears a garment
All velvet soft and black,
Pinned with the silver stars
Upon her back.

[Fantasy]
I sailed in my dreams to the Land of Night
Where you were the dusky Queen,
Clad in the star-dust’s silver light
And the moon’s pale, shimmerin’ sheen.

[Advice]
Save your tears for the rain,
Save your sighs for the wind,
Save your heart for the pain
That love leaves behind.

--- ANGELINA WELD GRIMKÉ ---
[The Black Finger]
I have just seen a beautiful thing
Slim and still,
Against a gold, gold sky,
A straight cypress,
Sensitive,
Exquisite,
A black finger
Pointing upwards.
Why, beautiful, still finger are you black?
And why are you pointing upwards?

[Tenebris]
There is a tree, by day,
That, at night,
Has a shadow,
A hand huge and black,
With fingers long and black.
All through the dark
Against the white man's house,
In the little wind,
The black hand plucks and plucks
At the bricks.
The bricks are the color of blood and very small.
Is it a black hand,
Or is it a shadow?

[A Mona Lisa]
I should like to creep
Through the long brown grasses
That are your lashes;
I should like to sleep
On the twin-mooned peaks
That are your breasts.

[When the Green Lies Over the Earth]
When the green lies over the earth, my dear,
A mantle of living joy;
When the red velvet rose is here,
And the butterfly, a flying toy...

[Paradox]
I am the woman with the black black skin
I am the laughing woman with the black black skin
I am the woman with the heavy heart
I am the woman who smiles.

[Dawn]
Grey trees, grey skies, and a grey, grey sea,
And a grey dawn creeping up the lea;
And a grey hope waking in the heart of me.

[Dusk]
Twin stars through my window pane,
The shriek of a train...
An owl's cry,
And memory.

[Grass Fingers]
Elusive, faint, fragile fingers,
Touching my face,
Touching my hands,
Touching my feet.
You are the fingers of the grass.

[Epitaph on a Living Woman]
She was a rose that bloomed in the winter,
A bird that sang in the snow.
She was a light that shone in the darkness,
A hope when the world was low.

[The Eyes of My Regret]
Always at my back I hear
The eyes of my regret;
They are like the eyes of a deer
That the hunter has not met.

--- STERLING A. BROWN ---
[Southern Road]
Swing dat hammer—hunh—
Steady, bo';
Swing dat hammer—hunh—
Steady, bo';
Ain't no rush, bebby,
Long ways to go.

[Ma Rainey]
When Ma Rainey
Comes to town,
Folks from anyplace
Miles aroun',
From Cape Girardeau,
Poplar Bluff,
Flocks in to hear
Ma do her stuff.

[Strong Men]
They dragged you from homeland,
They chained you in coffles,
They huddled you spoon-fashion in filthy hatches,
They sold you to give a few gentlemen ease.
...
The strong men keep a-comin' on
The strong men git stronger.

[Slim in Hell]
Slim Greer went to heaven;
St. Peter said, "Slim,
You been a right good boy."
An' he winked at him.
"You been a travelin' rascal
In yo' day.
You kin roam once mo';
Den you come to stay."

[Old Lem]
I talked to old Lem
And old Lem said:
"They weigh the cotton
They store the corn
We only good enough
To work the rows;
They run the commissary
They keep the books
We gotta be grateful
For being cheated."

[Riverbank Blues]
A man get weary
Sick and tired of waitin'
For the river to rise
And the sun to set.
Waiting for the levee
To break and let
The water wash away
His heavy debt.

[Sister Lou]
Honey
When de man
Calls out de las' train
You're gonna ride,
Tell him howdy.
Gather up yo' basket
An' yo' bundle an' yo' gal,
An' say goodbye.

[Memphis Blues]
Nineh's Gal
She's a high-steppin' dame
She don't talk to nobody
She don't know my name
But when she does the shimmy
She sets the town aflame.

[Odyssey of Big Boy]
Lemme be wid Casey Jones,
Lemme be wid Stagolee,
Lemme be wid such like men
When Death takes hol' of me,
When Death takes hol' of me.

[Long Gone]
I loves you, baby,
Deed I do,
But the road is callin'
And I must go.
Don't you cry, baby,
Don't you moan,
For I'll be back
When the wild wind's blown.
