### 📜 ANTHOLOGY EXAMPLES (GROUND TRUTH)

--- WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE ---
[Sonnet 18]
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer's lease hath all too short a date...

[Sonnet 130]
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.

[Sonnet 116]
Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove.

[Sonnet 29]
When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,
I all alone beweep my outcast state,
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
And look upon myself and curse my fate.

[Sonnet 73]
That time of year thou mayst in me behold
When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.

--- FRANCESCO PETRARCA ---
[Sonnet 90 (Era il giorno ch’al sol...)]
It was the day the sun's ray had turned pale
With pity for the suffering of his Maker,
When I was caught, and I put up no fight,
My lady, for your precious eyes unbound me.

[Sonnet 132 (S’amor non è...)]
If no love is, O God, what fele I so?
And if love is, what thing and which is he?
If love be good, from whence cometh my woe?
If it be wick, a wonder thinketh me.

[Sonnet 3 (La gola e 'l sonno...)]
Gluttony and sleep and pillows of sloth
Have banished every virtue from the world,
So that nature, wandering from her course,
Is almost overcome by custom's force.

--- EDMUND SPENSER ---
[Sonnet 75 (One day I wrote her name...)]
One day I wrote her name upon the strand,
But came the waves and washed it away:
Again I wrote it with a second hand,
But came the tide, and made my pains his prey.

[Sonnet 30 (My love is like to ice...)]
My love is like to ice, and I to fire:
How comes it then that this her cold so great
Is not dissolved through my so hot desire,
But harder grows the more I her entreat?

--- SIR PHILIP SIDNEY ---
[Sonnet 1 (Loving in truth...)]
Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show,
That the dear She might take some pleasure of my pain...
"Fool," said my Muse to me, "look in thy heart, and write."

[Sonnet 31 (With how sad steps, O Moon...)]
With how sad steps, O Moon, thou climb'st the skies!
How silently, and with how wan a face!
What, may it be that even in heavenly place
That busy archer his sharp arrows tries?

--- JOHN MILTON ---
[When I Consider How My Light is Spent]
When I consider how my light is spent,
Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide,
And that one Talent which is death to hide,
Lodged with me useless.

[On the Late Massacre in Piedmont]
Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughtered saints, whose bones
Lie scattered on the Alpine mountains cold,
Even them who kept thy truth so pure of old
When all our fathers worshipped stocks and stones.

--- WILLIAM WORDSWORTH ---
[Nuns Fret Not]
Nuns fret not at their convent’s narrow room;
And hermits are contented with their cells;
And students with their pensive citadels...
 In truth the prison, into which we doom
 Ourselves, no prison is.

[The World Is Too Much With Us]
The world is too much with us; late and soon,
Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;
Little we see in Nature that is ours;
We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!

--- ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING ---
[Sonnet 43 (How do I love thee?)]
How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of being and ideal grace.

[Sonnet 14 (If thou must love me...)]
If thou must love me, let it be for nought
Except for love's sake only. Do not say,
"I love her for her smile—her look—her way
Of speaking gently."

--- CHRISTINA ROSSETTI ---
[Remember]
Remember me when I am gone away,
Gone far away into the silent land;
When you can no more hold me by the hand,
Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.

[The World]
By day she woos me, soft, exceeding fair:
But all night as the moon so changeth she;
Loathsome and foul with hideous leprosy,
And subtle serpents gliding in her hair.

--- JOHN KEATS ---
[On First Looking into Chapman's Homer]
Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold,
And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
Round many western islands have I been
Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.

[Bright Star]
Bright star, would I were steadfast as thou art—
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night
And watching, with eternal lids apart,
Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite.

--- EDNA ST. VINCENT MILLAY ---
[What lips my lips have kissed]
What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why,
I have forgotten, and what arms have lain
Under my head till morning; but the rain
Is full of ghosts tonight, that tap and sigh.

[Love is not all]
Love is not all: it is not meat nor drink
Nor slumber nor a roof against the rain;
Nor yet a floating spar to men that sink
And rise and sink and rise and sink again.
