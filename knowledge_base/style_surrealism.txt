### 📜 ANTHOLOGY EXAMPLES (GROUND TRUTH)

--- ANDRÉ BRETON ---
[Free Union]
My wife with the wood-fire hair
With thoughts showing flashes of heat lightning
With the waist of an hourglass
My wife with the waist of an otter in the teeth of a tiger...
With eyes of water to drink in prison.

[Manifesto of Surrealism]
Surrealism, n. Psychic automatism in its pure state, by which one proposes to express... the actual functioning of thought.
Dictated by thought, in the absence of any control exercised by reason, exempt from any aesthetic or moral concern.

[The Magnetic Fields (with Soupault)]
The window has been hollowed out of the flesh.
A huge bird pecks at the heart.
The chemicals are angry.
Run, run, the sky is falling into the soup.

[Always for the First Time]
Always for the first time
I hardly know you by sight
You return at some hour of the night
To a house at an angle to my window
A wholly imaginary house.

[Vigilance]
I set fire to the hair of the stone woman...
The closet opens and it is the end of the world.
A single match destroys the stars.

[Postman Cheval]
We are the birds of the construction.
The cement of dreams holds the stones of reality.
A palace built of pebbles and stamps.

[Hotel of Sparks]
The bed is a boat floating on lava.
The pillow bites my ear.
The sheets are made of ghosts.

[Piscine]
The fish swim in the air.
The water is dry.
I dive into the mirror and break the glass.

[War]
The generals play chess with skulls.
The soldiers eat dirt and drink blood.
Peace is a white bird exploded by a grenade.

[Love]
Reciprocal love, the only truth.
The fusion of two sparks into a flame.
Burning the world to ash.

--- PAUL ÉLUARD ---
[The Earth is Blue]
The earth is blue like an orange
Never a mistake words do not lie
They no longer give you songs
It is the turn of kisses to understand.

[Liberty]
On my school notebooks
On my desk and the trees
On the sand on the snow
I write your name...
By the power of a word
I begin my life again
I was born to know you
To name you
Liberty.

[Lady Love]
She is standing on my eyelids
And her hair is in my hair
She has the colour of my eye
She has the body of my hand
In my shade she is engulfed.

[Capital of Pain]
I hide the sun in my pocket.
I walk in the night of my own making.
The stars are debts I cannot pay.

[Love Poetry]
The curve of your eyes goes around my heart,
A round of dance and sweetness,
Halo of time, nocturnal and sure Cradle,
And if I don't know all that I've lived
It's because your eyes didn't always see me.

[Max Ernst]
In a corner the incestuous agile
Turns around the virginity of the little dress.
The river of eyes, the lake of hair.

[L'Amoureuse]
She is isolated so that I am not alone.
She is the wall and the door.
She is the lock and the key.

[Curfew]
What can I do with this strength?
What can I do with this heart?
Nothing but love you
In the shadow of the war.

[Without Age]
We have no age.
We are the children of the moment.
Playing with fire, playing with time.

[Silence]
The silence is a loud noise.
It breaks the ears of the dead.
Speak to me, or I will die.

--- LOUIS ARAGON ---
[Paris Peasant]
The light of the modern is the unusual.
I wander the Passage de l'Opéra.
A cane shop, a stamp shop.
Mystery lurks behind the glass.
The mannequin winks at me.

[Elza at the Mirror]
It was in the middle of our tragedy
And all the long day sitting at her glass
She combed her bright gold hair...
Thinking she was combing out a fire.

[There is no happy love]
Nothing is given to man. Neither his strength
Nor his weakness nor his heart. And when he opens
His arms his shadow is that of a cross.
There is no happy love.

[Fire]
I burn, I burn, I burn.
The world is a box of matches.
My heart is the striker.
One scratch and boom.

[Red Front]
Shoot! Shoot!
Kill the cops, kill the priests.
The revolution is a gun.
Poetry is a bullet.

[Mimosa]
The flowers are yellow dust.
Sneezing gold in the wind.
Sensitive plant, do not touch.
Unless you want to die.

[Eyes of Elsa]
Your eyes are so deep that I lean down to drink
I saw all the suns come up in them to check
All the odd despairs wait there for death...

[Unemployed]
I walk the streets with empty pockets.
My hands are fists.
My hunger is a wolf.

[Nightwalker]
The night is my kingdom.
Only the cats and the ghosts know me.
Currently unavailable.

[Contraband]
I snuggle words across the border.
Dangerous goods.
Explosive ideas.

--- ROBERT DESNOS ---
[I have dreamed of you so much]
I have dreamed of you so much that you lose your reality.
Is there still time to reach that living body
And to kiss on that mouth the birth
Of the voice which is dear to me?

[Identity]
I am the shadow of a shadow.
A name written in water.
A voice in the wind.
Who am I? Ask the mirror.

[The Ant]
An ant of eighteen meters
With a hat on its head
It does not exist, it does not exist.
Why not?

[Sleep]
Sleep, sleep, sleep.
The world is a dream.
Wake up and you die.
Stay in the cocoon of night.

[Shipwreck]
The boat sinks in the glass of wine.
The captain is drunk on words.
The sailors are drowning in ink.

[Tomorrow]
Tomorrow I will be dead.
Tomorrow I will be free.
Tomorrow I will eat the sun.

[Apparition]
A ghost in a tuxedo.
Smoking a cigar of smoke.
He says: "Do you have a light?"
I give him my burning heart.

[Love Song]
I love you like the sea loves the sand.
Eating you, eroding you.
Leaving nothing but wet indifference.

[Last Poem (Terezin)]
Shadow of a crater
We will live
We will love.
(Written in a concentration camp)

[Epitaph]
Here lies Robert Desnos.
Poet, dreamer, lover.
He slept too much.
Now he sleeps forever.

At the Battle of the Marne.

I chase the moon.
I fall into the chimney.
Santa Claus is dead.

The end of the poem.
The end of the world.
The end of the line.
Full stop.

--- PHILIPPE SOUPAULT ---
[Westwego]
I am walking. I am walking.
Cities slide by like playing cards.
London, Paris, New York.
I am the ace of spades.

[Georgia]
I can't sleep.
It's the neon lights.
It's the jazz.
It's the memory of your face.

[Garages]
The smell of oil and grease.
The skeletons of cars.
A cemetery of speed.
Rust in peace.

Looking at myself.
Who is that stranger?
He looks like me.
But his eyes are dead.

[Sunday]
The bells ringing.
The people praying.
The rain falling.
Me drinking.

Burning time.
Grey clouds in the room.
Writing words on the air.

Life is a cigarette.
Smoke it to the butt.
Burn your fingers.
Throw it away.

Sing a song of sixpence.
Pocket full of rye.
Four and twenty blackbirds.
Pecking out my eye.

Washes the sins.
Washes the blood.
But the stain remains.

Train whistle.
Ship horn.
Goodbye.
Don't look back.

[Slate Roof]
On each slate
A memory writ in chalk
The rain erases it.
The roof is clean.
My mind is blank.

[Secret]
The empty bell.
The dead bird.
In the house where everything sleeps.
Nine o'clock.
The ground holds the shadow.

The head goes down.
The eyelashes dance.
It is an evening without a cigar.
The eyes are closed.

Someone just left.
In the room
There remains a sigh
A deserted life
The street is dark.
But on the pane
The sun puts a yellow hand.

[Combat]
Two wrestlers.
Shadow and light.
Grappling on the wall.
Night wins.

The horizon calls.
The line is straight.
Step over the edge.
Fall into blue.

The noise stops.
The heart stops.
The world stops.
Only the clock moves.

Looking behind me.
It follows.
It mocks.
It is me.

Open the window.
Let the outside in.
Or let the inside out.
Jump.

A hole in the sky.
Leaking light.
Drip, drip, drip.
Onto my face.

Dust to dust.
Word to word.
Silence to silence.
Gone.

There is a mind in the flesh, but a mind quick as lightning.
And yet the agitation of the flesh
partakes of the high substance of the mind.
