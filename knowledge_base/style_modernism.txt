### 📜 ANTHOLOGY EXAMPLES (GROUND TRUTH)

--- T.S. ELIOT ---
[The Waste Land]
April is the cruellest month, breeding
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
Memory and desire, stirring
Dull roots with spring rain.

[The Waste Land]
Unreal City,
Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,
A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,
I had not thought death had undone so many.
Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,
And each man fixed his eyes before his feet.

[The Waste Land]
These fragments I have shored against my ruins
Why then Ile fit you. Hieronymo's mad againe.
Datta. Dayadhvam. Damyata.
Shantih shantih shantih

[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]
Let us go then, you and I,
When the evening is spread out against the sky
Like a patient etherized upon a table;
Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
The muttering retreats
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels.

[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;
I know the voices dying with a dying fall
Beneath the music from a farther room.
So how should I presume?

[The Hollow Men]
We are the hollow men
We are the stuffed men
Leaning together
Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!

[The Hollow Men]
This is the way the world ends
This is the way the world ends
This is the way the world ends
Not with a bang but a whimper.

[Four Quartets: Burnt Norton]
Time present and time past
Are both perhaps present in time future,
And time future contained in time past.
If all time is eternally present
All time is unredeemable.

[Four Quartets: Little Gidding]
We shall not cease from exploration
And the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time.

[Gerontion]
Thoughts of a dry brain in a dry season.

--- EZRA POUND ---
[In a Station of the Metro]
The apparition of these faces in the crowd;
Petals on a wet, black bough.

[Canto I]
And then went down to the ship,
Set keel to breakers, forth on the godly sea, and
We set up mast and sail on that swart ship,
Bore sheep aboard her, and our bodies also
Heavy with weeping.

[Canto XLV - With Usura]
With usura hath no man a house of good stone
each block cut smooth and well fitting
that design might cover their face,
with usura
hath no man a painted paradise on his church wall.

[Hugh Selwyn Mauberley]
For three years, out of key with his time,
He strove to resuscitate the dead art
Of poetry; to maintain "the sublime"
In the old sense. Wrong from the start—

[Portrait d'une Femme]
Your mind and you are our Sargasso Sea,
London has swept about you this score years
And bright ships left you this or that in fee:
Ideas, old gossip, oddments of all things.

[The Return]
See, they return; ah, see the tentative
Movements, and the slow feet,
The trouble in the pace and the uncertain
Wavering!

[Canto LXXXI]
Pull down thy vanity, it is not man
Made courage, or made order, or made grace,
Pull down thy vanity, I say pull down.
Learn of the green world what can be thy place.

[The River-Merchant's Wife]
While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead
I played about the front gate, pulling flowers.
You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,
You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums.

[Ancient Music]
Winter is icummen in,
Lhude sing Goddamm.
Raineth drop and staineth slop,
And how the wind doth ramm!
Sing: Goddamm.

[Lament of the Frontier Guard]
By the North Gate, the wind blows full of sand,
Lonely from the beginning of time until now!
Trees fall, the grass goes yellow with autumn.
I climb the towers and towers to watch out the barbarous land.

--- W.B. YEATS ---
[The Second Coming]
Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.

[The Second Coming]
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.

[Sailing to Byzantium]
That is no country for old men. The young
In one another's arms, birds in the trees
—Those dying generations—at their song,
The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas.

[Leda and the Swan]
A sudden blow: the great wings beating still
Above the staggering girl, her thighs caressed
By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,
He holds her helpless breast upon his breast.

[Among School Children]
O body swayed to music, O brightening glance,
How can we know the dancer from the dance?

[Easter, 1916]
All changed, changed utterly:
A terrible beauty is born.

[The Lake Isle of Innisfree]
I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,
And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;
Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,
And live alone in the bee-loud glade.

[When You Are Old]
When you are old and grey and full of sleep,
And nodding by the fire, take down this book,
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep.

[The Circus Animals' Desertion]
I must lie down where all the ladders start
In the foul rag and bone shop of the heart.

[Byzantium]
The unpurged images of day recede;
The Emperor's drunken soldiery are abed;
Night resonance recedes, night-walkers' song
After great cathedral gong.

--- WALLACE STEVENS ---
[The Emperor of Ice-Cream]
Call the roller of big cigars,
The muscular one, and bid him whip
In kitchen cups concupiscent curds.
Let the wenches dawdle in such dress
As they are used to wear, and let the boys
Bring flowers in last month's newspapers.
Let be be finale of seem.
The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.

[Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird]
I
Among twenty snowy mountains,
The only moving thing
Was the eye of the blackbird.

[Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird]
V
I do not know which to prefer,
The beauty of inflections
Or the beauty of innuendoes,
The blackbird whistling
Or just after.

[Sunday Morning]
Complacencies of the peignoir, and late
Coffee and oranges in a sunny chair,
And the green freedom of a cockatoo
Upon a rug mingle to dissipate
The holy hush of ancient sacrifice.

[The Idea of Order at Key West]
She sang beyond the genius of the sea.
The water never formed to mind or voice,
Like a body wholly body, fluttering
Its empty sleeves; and yet its mimic motion
Made constant cry, caused constantly a cry.

[Anecdote of the Jar]
I placed a jar in Tennessee,
And round it was, upon a hill.
It made the slovenly wilderness
Surround that hill.

[The Snow Man]
One must have a mind of winter
To regard the frost and the boughs
Of the pine-trees crusted with snow;
...
And have been cold a long time
To behold the junipers shagged with ice,
The spruces rough in the distant glitter.

[The Man on the Dump]
The dump is full of images.
Days pass like papers from a press.
The bouquets come here in the wood.
So the sun, and so the moon.

[Of Modern Poetry]
The poem of the mind in the act of finding
What will suffice. It has not always had
To find: the scene was set; it repeated what
Was in the script.

[Final Soliloquy of the Interior Paramour]
Light the first light of evening, as in a room
In which we rest and, for small reason, think
The world imagined is the ultimate good.

--- WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS ---
[The Red Wheelbarrow]
so much depends
upon
a red wheel
barrow
glazed with rain
water
beside the white
chickens.

[This Is Just To Say]
I have eaten
the plums
that were in
the icebox
and which
you were probably
saving
for breakfast
Forgive me
they were delicious
so sweet
and so cold.

[Spring and All]
By the road to the contagious hospital
under the surge of the blue
mottled clouds driven from the
northeast-a cold wind.

[Danse Russe]
If I when my wife is sleeping
and the baby and Kathleen
are sleeping
and the sun is a flame-white disc
in silken mists
above shining trees...

[Portrait of a Lady]
Your thighs are appletrees
whose blossoms touch the sky.
Which sky? The sky
wherewatteau hung a lady's
slipper.

[The Great Figure]
Among the rain
and lights
I saw the figure 5
in gold
on a red
firetruck.

[Tract]
I will teach you my townspeople
how to perform a funeral
for you have it over a troop
of artists—
unless one should scour the world—
you have the ground sense necessary.

[Queen-Anne's-Lace]
Her body is not so white as
anemony petals nor so smooth—nor
so remote a thing. It is a field
of the wild carrot taking
the field by force.

[To Elsie]
The pure products of America
go crazy—
mountain folk from Kentucky
or the ribbed north end of
Jersey.

[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]
According to Brueghel
when Icarus fell
it was spring
a farmer was ploughing
his field
the whole pageantry
of the year was
awake tingling.

--- H.D. (HILDA DOOLITTLE) ---
[Sea Rose]
Rose, harsh rose,
marred and with stint of petals,
meagre flower, thin,
sparse of leaf,
more precious
than a wet rose
single on a stem.

[Sea Poppies]
Amber husk
fluted with gold,
fruit on the sand,
marked with a rich grain,
treasure
spilled near the shrub-pines
to bleach on the boulders.

[Oread]
Whirl up, sea—
whirl your pointed pines,
splash your great pines
on our rocks,
hurl your green over us,
cover us with your pools of fir.

[Storm]
You crash over the trees,
you crack the live branch—
the branch is white,
the green crushed,
each leaf is rent like split wood.

[Garden]
You are clear
O rose, cut in rock,
hard as the descent of hail.
I could scrape the colour
from the petals
like spilt dye from a rock.

[Heat]
O wind, rend open the heat,
cut apart the heat,
rend it to tatters.
Fruit cannot drop
through this thick air—
fruit cannot fall into heat
that presses up and blunts
the points of pears.

[Helen]
All Greece hates
the still eyes in the white face,
the lustre as of olives
where she stands,
and the white hands.

[The Walls Do Not Fall]
An incident here and there,
and rails gone (for guns)
from your (and my) old town square.

[The Pool]
Are you alive?
I touch you.
You quiver like a sea-fish.
I cover you with my net.
What are you—banded one?

[Eurydice]
So you have swept me back,
I who could have walked with the live souls
above the earth,
I who could have slept among the live flowers
at last.

--- MARIANNE MOORE ---
[Poetry]
I, too, dislike it: there are things that are important beyond all this fiddle.
Reading it, however, with a perfect contempt for it, one discovers in
it after all, a place for the genuine.

[The Fish]
wade
through black jade.
Of the crow-blue mussel-shells, one keeps
adjusting the ash-heaps;
opening and shutting itself like
an
injured fan.

[No Swan So Fine]
"No water so still as the
dead fountains of Versailles." No swan,
with swart blind look askance
and gondoliering legs, so fine
as the chintz china one with fawn-
brown eyes and toothed gold
collar on to show whose bird it was.

[The Steenbok]
The small steenbok
or grysbok,
moves through the scrub—
a skipping little buck—
on tiptoe.

[A Grave]
Man looking into the sea,
taking the view from those who have as much right to it as you have to it yourself,
it is human nature to stand in the middle of a thing,
but you cannot stand in the middle of this.

[The Pangolin]
Another armored animal—scale
lapping scale with spruce-cone regularity until they
form the uninterrupted central
tail-row!

[Silence]
My father used to say,
"Superior people never make long visits,
have to be shown Longfellow's grave
or the glass flowers at Harvard."

[Marriage]
This institution,
perhaps one should say enterprise
out of respect for which
one says one need not change one’s mind
about a thing one has believed in.

[An Octopus]
of ice. Deceptively reserved and flat,
it lies "in grandeur and in mass"
beneath a sea of shifting snow-dunes;
dots of cyclamen-red and maroon on its clearly defined
pseudo-podia.

[To a Snail]
If "compression is the first grace of style,"
you have it. Contractility is a virtue
as modesty is a virtue.

--- HART CRANE ---
[To Brooklyn Bridge]
How many dawns, chill from his rippling rest
The seagull’s wings shall dip and pivot him,
Shedding white rings of tumult, building high
Over the chained bay waters Liberty—

[Proem: To Brooklyn Bridge]
And Thee, across the harbor, silver-paced
As though the sun took step of thee, yet left
Some motion ever unspent in thy stride,—
Implicitly thy freedom staying thee!

[The Broken Tower]
The bell-rope that gathers God at dawn
Dispatches me as though I dropped down the knell
Of a spent day - to wander the cathedral lawn
From pit to crucifix, feet chill on steps from hell.

[Voyages]
Infinite consanguinity it bears—
This tendered theme of you that light
Retrieves from sea plains where the sky
Resigns a breast that every wave enthrones.

[Chaplinesque]
We make our meek adjustments,
Contented with such random consolations
As the wind deposits
In slithered and too ample pockets.

[My Grandmother's Love Letters]
There are no stars to-night
But those of memory.
Yet how much room for memory there is
In the loose girdle of soft rain.

[At Melville's Tomb]
Often beneath the wave, wide from this ledge
The dice of drowned men's bones he saw bequeath
An embassy. Their numbers as he watched,
Beat on the dusty shore and were obscured.

[The River]
Stick your patent name on a signboard
brother—all over—going west—young man
Tintex—Japalac—Certain-teed Overalls ads
and lands sakes! under the new playbill ripped...

[The Dance]
The swift red flesh, a winter king—
Who squired the glacier woman down the sky?
She ran the neighing canyons all the spring;
She spouted arms; she rose with maize—to die.

[Cutty Sark]
I met a man in South Street, tall—
a nervous shark tooth swung on his chain.
His eyes pressed through green grass
—green glasses, or bar lights made them
so.

[Songs to Joannes, I]
Spawn of fantasies
Silting the appraisable
Pig Cupid     his rosy snout
Rooting erotic garbage
"Once upon a time"
Pulls a weed     white star-topped

[Songs to Joannes, II]
The skin-sack
In which a wanton duality
Packed
All the completions of my infructuous impulses
Something the shape of a man

[Lunar Baedeker]
A silver Lucifer
serves
cocaine in cornucopias
To some somnambulists
of adolescent thighs
draped
in satirical draperies

The damnable tediousness
of adolescence
eliminated
by a sudden blow
The void that the eyes were
stare inward
into the skull-look.

[Love Songs]
We might have given birth to a butterfly
With the daily news
Printed in blood on its wings

[Parturition]
I am the centre
Of a circle of pain
Exceeding its boundaries in every direction
The business of the bland sun
Has no more coincidence with me
Than with the dead

[Apology of Genius]
Ostracized as we are with God
The watchers of the civilized wastes
reverse their signals on our track

[Gertrude Stein]
Curie
of the laboratory
of vocabulary
she crushed
the tonnage
of consciousness
congealed to phrases

[Brancusi's Golden Bird]
The toy
become the aesthetic archetype
As if
some patient peasant God
had rubbed and rubbed
the Alpha and Omega
of Form

[Feminist Manifesto]
The feminist movement as at present instituted is
Inadequate. 
Women must destroy in themselves, the desire to be loved
The desire to be lovable
The desire to be understood.
